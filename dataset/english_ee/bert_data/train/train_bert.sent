The es ##cal ##ation came as pro ##- ##go ##vern ##ment forces were also expected to enter the northern Kurdish ##- ##con ##tro ##lled en ##clave of A ##f ##rin ##, to take a stand against a month ##- ##old Turkish assault there ##. Held by rebels since 2012 ##, Eastern G ##hout ##a is the last opposition pocket around Damascus and President Ba ##sha ##r al ##- ##As ##sad has dispatched reinforcements there in an apparent concert ##ed effort to re ##take it ##. A barrage of air strikes ##, rocket fire and artillery slammed into several towns across Eastern G ##hout ##a on Monday ##. The Britain ##- ##base ##d Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 children were among 100 civilians killed in the assault ##, while around 300 other people were wounded ##. “ ##T ##he regime is bombing Eastern G ##hout ##a to p ##ave the way for a ground offensive ##, ##” said Observatory head Ram ##i Abd ##el Rahman ##. The main opposition National Coalition ##, which is based in Turkey ##, denounced the “ ##war of ex ##ter ##mination ##” in Eastern G ##hout ##a as well as the “ ##int ##ern ##ational silence ##” ##.

But es ##cal ##ating military pressure indicate that the regime would op ##t for a ground assault instead of talks ##, the monitor said ##.

Two fire ##men and a few on ##look ##ers received minor injuries in the ensuing r ##ump ##us as the con ##f ##lag ##ration set off balls of fire ##. The incident reminiscent of 2017 Amar ##son Pol ##yme ##rs building collapse had fire ##men on the alert ##. The blaze started from the second floor of the building — which housed two ho ##sie ##ry units ##, one of garments and a god ##own — around 9 ##pm Thursday ##.

While one group of fire ##men went to the first floor ##, the other carried out the operation on the second floor ##. As the flames sprawled towards the ground floor ##, the fire ##men rushed out ##.

The patient discharged on Tuesday ##. Ta ##ri ##que ( ##24 ##) was released from the Apollo Glen ##ea ##gles hospital during the day ##, a month after the critical brain surgery ##, said to be unprecedented in eastern India ##. “ ##T ##ari ##que suffered a car accident on April 28 in which a 3 ##. ##5 ft long iron rod of the roads ##ide divide ##r broke and went through his forehead leaving him pro ##fuse ##ly bleeding and with very little life expect ##ancy when he was brought to the hospital ##, ##” said Bin ##od Kumar Singh ##ania ##, consultant ne ##uro surgeon at the hospital ##. The doctor revealed they had to get on with the surgery without much prior knowledge about the extent of the patient ##’ ##s brain damage as it was difficult to conduct a CT scan with such a big piece of metal stuck in his head ##. They eventually removed the rod through a unique end ##os ##copic process with proper ha ##em ##ost ##asis — a process which causes bleeding to stop ##. “ ##T ##he case was extremely trick ##y as the biggest challenge was to mini ##mise the bleeding inside the skull after removing the metal rod ##. As the brain remains enclosed inside the skull ##, too much bleeding could have damaged a large number of brain cells that may have led to the patient ##’ ##s death ##, ##” the doctor said ##. Singh ##ania admitted that he hasn ##’ ##t performed such an operation in his 30 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##long career as a ne ##uro ##su ##rge ##on ##. “ ##T ##he operation was successful and it was found that the patient did not suffer any major vessel damage in the accident ##.

[unused1] [unused2] 19 kids among 94 dead as Iraq ferry on holiday trip sinks in T ##ig ##ris River Over 90 people ##, mostly women and children ##, died as a ferry packed with families celebrating Kurdish New Year sank in a swollen river in the former ji ##had ##ist stronghold of Mo ##sul ##, in Iraq ##’ ##s worst accident in years ##. There was an out ##po ##uring of grief among residents who only this year resumed the annual festivities on the banks of the T ##ig ##ris after the northern city ##’ ##s re ##cap ##ture from the Islamic State group ##. Prime minister Ad ##el Abd ##el Ma ##hdi decree ##d three days of national mourning as he visited the site of the tragedy ##. He ordered a swift investigation “ ##to determine responsibilities ##” ##. The vessel was c ##ram ##med with men ##, women and children crossing the T ##ig ##ris Thursday to go to a popular picnic area to celebrate Now ##ru ##z ##, the Kurdish New Year and a holiday across Iraq marking the start of spring ##. The accident ##, which struck as the over ##loaded vessel turned back ##, also coincided with Mother ##’ ##s Day in Iraq ##. The interior ministry ##, issuing a fresh toll ##, said 94 people had died and 55 were rescued ##, after its spokesman Sa ##ad Ma ##an said at least 19 children were among the dead ##. The premier said 61 women had died in the accident ##. While war and ji ##had ##ist attacks have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in Iraq in recent years ##, such accidents are relatively rare ##. “ ##I ##t ##’ ##s a disaster ##, no one expected that ##, ##” said a young man who had just managed to reach the shore ##. “ ##T ##here were a lot of people on the boat ##, especially women and children ##, ##” he told A ##FP ##. A Mo ##sul security source said the high water levels and over ##crow ##ding on the boat ##, with well over 100 people on board ##, had been to blame for the disaster ##. “ ##T ##he boat sank because there were too many passengers on board ##, ##” another security official based in Mo ##sul told A ##FP ##. Iraq ##’ ##s justice ministry said it had ordered the arrest of nine ferry company officials and banned the owners of the vessel and the tourist site from leaving the country ##. The authorities had warned people to be cautious after several days of heavy rains led to water being released through the Mo ##sul dam ##, causing the river level to rise ##. Video ##s shared on social media showed a fast ##- ##flow ##ing ##, b ##loat ##ed river and dozens of people floating in the water or trying to swim around the partly submerged boat ##. Search operations stretched far downstream from the site where the boat sank ##, according to an A ##FP journalist ##. Hundreds of people who had flock ##ed to the forested area for the first days of spring gathered on the river banks as the disaster unfolded ##. Ambulance ##s and police vehicles transported the dead and wounded to hospitals in the city of nearly two million people ##. Photo ##s of victims ##, many of them women and children ##, were posted on the walls of a m ##or ##gue for families unable to enter because of the large crowd who had gathered to identify their relatives ##. One man ##, scanning over the pictures ##, stopped abruptly at the image of a woman ##. In shock ##, he gasped ##: “ ##I ##t ##’ ##s my wife ##” ##, before collapsing in tears ##. IS turned Mo ##sul into their de facto Iraqi capital after the ji ##had ##ists swept across much of the country ##’ ##s north in 2014 ##. The city spent three years under the group ##’ ##s iron ##- ##fi ##sted rule until it was recaptured by Iraqi troops backed by a US ##- ##led coalition in 2017 ##.

[unused1] [unused2] Safety gear failed in Mirage crash that killed both pilots The deaths of two Indian Air Force ( ##IA ##F ##) test pilots in a Mirage 2000 crash at the Hindus ##tan Aero ##na ##uti ##cs Ltd ( ##HA ##L ##) airport in Bengal ##uru last week may have been caused in part by arrest ##er barriers ##, critical airfield safety equipment ##, giving way ##, officials with first ##- ##hand information of the matter said on condition of an ##ony ##mity ##. The reason for the crash itself remain unknown — the black box of the fighter has been sent to France for analysis — but the death of the pilots could have been a ##verted if the barriers ##, meant to stop the aircraft ##, had held ##, one of the officials added ##. “ ##O ##nce the arrest ##ers gave way ##, there was little chance that the two had of bringing the aircraft to rest ##, ##” he said ##. The two pilots ##, Squadron Leader Sami ##r A ##bro ##l and Squadron Leader Sid ##dha ##rth ##a N ##eg ##i ##, died on the spot ##. The arrest ##ers installed at H ##AL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160 ##- ##17 ##0 knots ##. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less ##, 13 ##- ##14 tonnes ##, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots ##, the officials added ##. A ##bro ##l and N ##eg ##i were on an “ ##ac ##ce ##pta ##nce sort ##ie ##” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhaul ##ed by the Bengal ##uru ##- ##base ##d ##, state ##- ##own ##ed company ##. The sort ##ie was taking place on the H ##AL runway in Ye ##mal ##ur in Bengal ##uru on February 1 ##. An H ##AL spokesperson declined comment ##. An Indian Air Force ( ##IA ##F ##) spokesperson ##, too ##, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident ##. The accident occurred a day after I ##AF chief Air Chief Marshal BS D ##han ##oa criticised H ##AL ##, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state ##- ##own ##ed firm ##’ ##s indigenous ##ly developed aircraft ##. According to the officials ##, the number of times major s ##na ##gs have been detected by I ##AF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhaul ##ed or manufactured by H ##AL is high ##. For instance ##, last June ##, an Su ##- ##30 was on an acceptance sort ##ie ( ##its 13th ##) when it crashed near Nash ##ik ##. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully ##. These sort ##ies are done by I ##AF only after H ##AL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance ##. In 2018 ##- ##20 ##19 ##, the Russian designed Su ##- ##30 ##M ##ki – the main ##sta ##y fighter of the I ##AF – manufactured by H ##AL required as many as six sort ##ies as against the designated two sort ##ies before they could be accepted ##. “ ##T ##he increased number of sort ##ies is because s ##na ##gs were found ##, ##” a second senior government official said ##. Similarly ##, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhaul ##ed by H ##AL have ##, on average ##, required two sort ##ies more than the mandatory number because of s ##na ##gs ##. And ##, Jaguar ##s ##, the British made deep ##- ##st ##rik ##e bombers that are overhaul ##ed by H ##AL ##, have required ##, on average ##, three sort ##ies more than the two sort ##ies designated for acceptance ##. For the advanced light helicopters ( ##AL ##H ##) ##, flown by the Indian Army ##, Navy and Air Force ##, and also made by H ##AL ##, the numbers are equally bad ##. “ ##E ##ver ##y aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sort ##ies testing various test points before it can be accepted by I ##AF for deployment ##. The fact that the more sort ##ies are having to be flown to re ##ct ##ify the s ##na ##gs indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorous ##ness at the H ##AL end ##, ##” said Air Marshal S ##B ##P Sin ##ha ( ##ret ##d ##) ##, who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of I ##AF ##. A ##rre ##ster barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhaul ##ed Mirage 2000 trainer was facing ##. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either a ##bor ##ted take ##- ##off or made an emergency landing from overs ##hoot ##ing the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew ##. In this case ##, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take ##- ##off ##. The under ##car ##ria ##ge of the aircraft was shear ##ed off ##, most likely because of the impact ##. And the arrest ##er barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop ##. The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry ( ##C ##o ##I ##) that is investigating the crash ##. “ ##S ##ep ##arate ##ly ##, in ##quiries are also being conducted on why the arrest ##er barrier gave way ##, ##” said a senior H ##AL official who asked not to be named ##.

This year ##, the Forest Department was app ##re ##hen ##sive that the vol ##uminous mass of la ##nta ##na which covers almost 60 ##% of the forest could provide additional fuel in case of a fire ##, and their fears have come true ##. Also ##, heavy rains during monsoon and un ##sea ##son ##al ones during November helped in the luxurious growth of vegetation ##, all of which dry up during summer ##, providing ample fuel for the fire to rage ##. The authorities had anticipated such a scenario and deployed nearly 400 watch ##ers ##. But it is re ##ckoned to be inadequate for the national park ##, which is spread over 91 ##2 sq ##. ##k ##m ##. San ##jay G ##ub ##bi ##, a conservation biologist ##, said controlling fires needs a multi ##- ##p ##rong ##ed approach and prevention is the best solution ##. “ ##A ##n effective communication network ##, especially wireless systems ##, is of immense importance for early detection and control of forest fires ##.

Emergency officials feared the death toll could climb after a fire broke out in the Tong ##i Industrial Zone about 20 ##k ##m north of Dhaka ##. The cause was not immediately known ##, but officials said a boiler explosion probably triggered the blaze at around 02 ##00 GM ##T as workers prepared to swap shifts ##. " ##T ##here were about 100 people inside the building when fire broke out ##, ##" Mohammad Na ##yan ##, a worker who was helping with rescue efforts ##, told reporters ##.

" ##W ##e cannot confirm whether any people are inside or not ##, but our priority is to rescue them if there is anyone inside ##, ##" Mohammad A ##kh ##tar ##uz ##zam ##an ##, a fire department official at the site ##, told Re ##uters over the phone ##. Another fire official said that although the blaze was under control ##, there were still flames inside the building so fire fighters had been unable to search the debris ##. A manager at Tampa ##co F ##oil ##s said he did not know how many people were inside the factory when the blaze broke out ##. " ##N ##ow my only focus is on my workers who were injured and on those who died ##. We will take care of them ##, ##" said Syed Mo ##k ##bul Ho ##ssa ##in ##, chair of Tampa ##co and a former MP ##.

In the Rana Plaza disaster ##, 1 ##, ##13 ##5 mainly garment industry workers were killed when a building collapsed outside Dhaka ##. That sparked demands for greater safety in the country ##.

[unused1] [unused2] No ##ida sees 2 road accidents ##, one casual ##ty every day ##, shows data While several departments of the No ##ida authority have been observing the annual road safety week ##, with awareness and ch ##all ##an drives ##, the result seems ne ##gli ##gible ##, according to police data ##, which shows that traffic ##- ##rel ##ated accidents and deaths are consistently on the rise ##. According to official records ##, on average ##, there are at least two incidents and one death every day in No ##ida due to road accidents ##. The total number of accidents in No ##ida was 93 ##3 in 2015 and 92 ##6 in 2016 ##. This grew to 1 ##, ##0 ##43 in 2017 and 1 ##, ##0 ##6 ##7 in 2018 ##. The total number of fatalities in these accidents also grew ##, from 36 ##2 in 2015 to 38 ##2 in 2016 ##, 42 ##3 in 2017 and 45 ##2 in 2018 ##. A similar increase can be seen in the number of injured persons as well ##. Official ##s said that the maximum number of accidents take place along expressway ##s ##. No ##ida has a large share of expressway ##s and state highways passing through the city ##. “ ##M ##ost accidents are because of speeding on high speed corridors such as expressway ##s and state highways ##. Approximately 5 ##% of roads in No ##ida are highways ##, which is higher than the share in other cities ##, ##” An ##il Kumar J ##ha ##, superintendent of police ( ##tra ##ff ##ic ##) ##, said ##. He said the increase in accidents can also be correlated with the increasing ve ##hic ##ular population of the city and vehicles visiting the city ##. He added that while the number of casualties is increasing at the rate of 6 ##. ##8 ##% in No ##ida ##, number of vehicles passing through is increasing at a rate of 20 ##- ##25 ##% every year ##. “ ##I ##n the past few years ##, the condition of roads in No ##ida as well as across Uttar Pradesh has also improved ##. However ##, it is ironic that even as roads improved ##, it led to increased speed and therefore ##, more accidents ##. We are trying to deal with it by surveying the most vulnerable spots ##, following which we will inform people about them ##, ##” J ##ha said ##. He said that the maximum number of traffic violations in the city is due to speeding ##, driving on the wrong side ##, and not wearing helmets and seat belts ##. Therefore ##, awareness drives during the road safety week are essential for improving driver behaviour and road discipline in G ##aut ##am Bud ##h Nagar ##, he added ##. Meanwhile ##, though several activities are planned for the ongoing road safety week ##, residents said such superficial activities do not help with road safety on the streets ##. Residents said it would help more if officials would make changes in road design and increase enforcement activities against traffic viola ##tors ##. “ ##T ##he e ##- ##chal ##lan ##s may be increasing but we don ##’ ##t see much impact on ground ##. Driving on the wrong side causes several accidents but no action is taken ##.

It goes to direct that phone call records of the known telephone numbers of the lady may also be obtained and examined to find out whether the former CO had made calls ##, messages ##, What ##s ##A ##pp communication to verify the allegations made against him ##. The orders also explicitly mention that the inquiry should also take into consideration any other relevant facts or information considered necessary ##, including acts of moral t ##ur ##pit ##ude ##, if any ##, which may come during the Court of Inquiry proceedings with regard to allegations made against the Colonel ##.

[unused1] [unused2] UN calls for Libya cease ##fire as death toll climbs to 1 ##, ##00 ##0 The UN Security Council called on Friday for a cease ##fire in Libya as the death toll from a three ##- ##mont ##h offensive on Tripoli reached 1 ##, ##00 ##0 ##, including scores killed in an air strike that hit a detention centre for migrants ##. The council condemned the late Tuesday attack on the Ta ##jou ##ra detention camp east of Tripoli and " ##st ##ressed the need for all parties to urgent ##ly de ##- ##es ##cal ##ate the situation and to commit to a cease ##fire ##" ##, said a joint statement ##. Libyan commander K ##hali ##fa Ha ##ft ##ar ##, whose forces hold eastern Libya and much of the country ##' ##s south ##, launched an offensive in early April to w ##restle the capital from forces loyal to the UN ##- ##re ##co ##gni ##sed Government of National A ##cco ##rd ( ##G ##NA ##) ##. Air strikes and ground fighting have since left nearly 1 ##, ##00 ##0 people dead and some 5 ##, ##00 ##0 wounded ##, the UN ##' ##s World Health Organization said ##. The fighting has forced more than 100 ##, ##00 ##0 people to flee their homes and threatens to p ##lung ##e Libya into deeper conflict ##. Among the dead are 53 migrants killed Tuesday night in an air raid on a detention centre in the Tripoli suburb of Ta ##jou ##ra ##, held by the G ##NA ##, which accused Ha ##ft ##ar ##' ##s forces of carrying out the strike ##. A Geneva ##- ##base ##d spokesman for the International Organization for Mi ##gration said six children were among the migrants killed ##. Joel Mill ##man said that 350 migrants ##, including 20 women and four children ##, were still detained at the centre ##, one of five air hangar ##s hit in the raid ##. World powers have been divided over how to respond to Ha ##ft ##ar ##' ##s offensive ##, with the United States and Russia refusing to con ##de ##m ##n the Libyan strong ##man ##. The British ##- ##dra ##fted council statement condemned the attack on the migrant camp ##, called for a return to political talks and for full respect of the arms em ##bar ##go on Libya ##. It followed a closed ##- ##do ##or council meeting on Wednesday during which US diplomat ##s said they needed more time to consult with Washington on the proposed text ##. The United Nations has called for an independent investigation to determine who was responsible for the strike on the centre ##, which housed some 600 migrants ##, mainly from African countries ##. President Re ##ce ##p Ta ##y ##yi ##p E ##rdo ##gan of Turkey - ##- which backs the G ##NA - ##- called for an end to " ##un ##law ##ful attacks ##" by Ha ##ft ##ar ##' ##s forces during a meeting with Libyan Prime Minister Faye ##z al ##- ##S ##arra ##j in Istanbul on Friday ##, the Turkish presidency said ##. UN shared coordinates UN agencies and humanitarian groups have repeatedly voiced concern over the p ##light of thousands of migrants and refugees held in detention centres near combat zones in the capital ##. Secretary ##- ##G ##ener ##al Antonio G ##uter ##res has expressed outrage over the attack and said the United Nations had shared the coordinates of the detention centre with the war ##ring sides to protect the civilians ##. The car ##nage in Ta ##jou ##ra was " ##a tragedy that should have never happened ##" ##, said Charlie Ya ##xley ##, spokesman for the UN ##' ##s refugee agency ##. Libya has become a major con ##du ##it for migrants seeking to reach Europe and remains prey to numerous militia ##s v ##ying for control of the country ##' ##s oil wealth ##. Rights groups say migrants face ho ##rri ##fying abuses in Libya ##, and their p ##light has worse ##ned since Ha ##ft ##ar launched the offensive against Tripoli ##. According to the UN ##, some 5 ##, ##70 ##0 refugees and migrants are being held in detention centres in Libya ##, 3 ##, ##30 ##0 of whom are vulnerable to fighting in and around Tripoli ##. Plan ##e downed An initial lightning assault in early April saw Ha ##ft ##ar ##' ##s self ##- ##style ##d Libyan National Army steam towards the capital ##. But they have since been b ##ogged down on its southern outskirts ##, where front ##lines have been frozen for months ##. G ##NA forces launched a surprise counter ##- ##att ##ack late last month ##, se ##izing the strategic town of G ##har ##yan ##, the main supply base for Ha ##ft ##ar ##' ##s offensive ##. After the set ##back ##, Ha ##ft ##ar ##' ##s forces threatened to in ##tens ##ify strikes against their rivals ##. Both sides have launched daily air raids throughout the fighting and each lost several planes ##. The rival camps have remained convinced that with the help of their back ##ers ##, they can win the battle ##. The G ##NA receives support from Turkey and Qatar ##, and Ha ##ft ##ar is backed by the United Arab Emirates ##, Egypt ##, and according to experts ##, to some degree by the United States ##.
