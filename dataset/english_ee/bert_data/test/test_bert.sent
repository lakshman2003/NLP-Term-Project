The number of deaths from Wednesday ##’ ##s flooding increased to 16 after firefighters found the body of a man in the swamp ##ed basement of a home in the N ##ea Per ##amo ##s district west of Athens ##. Search and rescue operations were continuing Thursday for four more people reported missing since the floods turned roads into violent to ##rre ##nts of mud and debris ##. The disaster was among the worst to hit the Greek capital in decades ##, and the government declared a day of national mourning ##. Flags across the country flew at half ##- ##sta ##ff Thursday ##, including at the ancient A ##c ##ropolis landmark in Athens ##. The hardest hit area was Man ##dra ##, a modest working ##- ##c ##lass district on the western outskirts of the Greek capital ##, where nearly all the fatalities occurred ##.

Wednesday ##’ ##s flash floods ##, which came after a severe overnight storm ##, carried away vehicles ##, collapsed walls ##, sank fishing boats and submerged a section of a major highway “ ##T ##here is huge damage ##.

More storms las ##hed the Greek capital on Thursday ##, temporarily se ##vering traffic on one of Athens ##’ main central avenue ##s ##, although they did not cause flash floods ##. Local municipalities were providing hotel rooms for those left homeless ##, while the Merchant Marine Ministry said it was making arrangements for a cruise ship to dock on the coast near the affected area to provide temporary accommodation ##. It also said arrangements were being made with the army and navy to provide water tanker ##s to transport clean water to residents ##.

Twelve of the dead were found there ##, while the bodies of two men were picked up by the coast guard after having been swept out to sea by the flood ##.

Mount ##ing calls for a humanitarian truce in one of the blood ##iest episodes of Syria ##’ ##s seven ##- ##ye ##ar conflict failed to stop 46 more people being killed on Thursday by air strikes and rocket fire ##. Reg ##ime back ##er Russia said there was “ ##no agreement ##” at the UN Security Council on a 30 ##- ##day cease ##fire for Syria and presented amendments to a draft resolution that would allow aid deliver ##ies and the evacuation of civilians from besieged Eastern G ##hout ##a ##. As diplomat ##s w ##rang ##led over a UN vote ##, which could take place Friday ##, people huddled in basement ##s while government forces pounded the en ##clave with rockets and bombs ##, turning towns into fields of ruins and even hitting hospitals ##. Aid group Doctors Without Borders said 13 of the facilities it supports in Eastern G ##hout ##a were damaged or destroyed in three days ##, leaving remaining staff with very little to save the hundreds of wounded brought to them every day ##. In the hospital m ##ort ##uary in Do ##uma ##, the main town in the en ##clave just east of Damascus ##, bodies wrapped in white s ##hr ##oud ##s were already lined up on the floor ##, two of them children ##. “ ##F ##ive days of air strikes and intense artillery fire by the regime and its Russian ally have killed 40 ##3 civilians ##, including 95 children ##, ##” said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights ##. Morning rain appeared to initially keep war ##planes away yesterday but the sky cleared by mid ##day and jets ##, some of them Russian according to the Observatory ##, soon returned ##. Russia has so far denied direct involvement in the assault on G ##hout ##a but the pro ##- ##go ##vern ##ment Syrian newspaper Al ##- ##W ##ata ##n reported yesterday that Russian war ##planes and adviser ##s had joined the battle ##.

The brief re ##sp ##ite provided by the rain yesterday encouraged some residents to venture out of their basement ##s and shelters ##, to buy food ##, check on their property or en ##quire about their relatives and neighbours ##. In the town of Ham ##mu ##ri ##yeh ##, a que ##ue had formed outside a shop as starving residents tried to stock up but another rocket so ##wed panic and sent everybody back to their shelters ##. In Do ##uma ##, a young boy tried to p ##edd ##le lighter ##s on the street but rocket fire quickly forced him to s ##cam ##per back to cover ##. An A ##FP correspondent saw rescue ##rs known as the “ ##W ##hit ##e He ##lm ##ets ##” forced to abandon efforts to retrieve a wounded woman from the rubble of a collapsed home when air strikes resumed ##. When they ventured back to the site ##, the woman was dead ##. The in ##dis ##c ##rim ##inate bombardment and the strikes on medical facilities have sparked global outrage but few concrete options have emerged to stop the blood ##lett ##ing ##. The aid community voiced its frustration as the world appeared once again power ##less to stop a conflict that has left almost 350 ##, ##00 ##0 dead in seven years and caused destruction rarely seen since World War II ##. Human ##itarian agencies are “ ##si ##cke ##ned that no matter how many times they ##’ ##ve raised the alarm ##, taken the step of speaking out ##, called on the Security Council to do something ##, the violence and brutality will sink to new low ##s ##” ##, said the Syria IN ##G ##O Regional Forum ##. At the UN ##, Russian Ambassador V ##ass ##ily N ##eb ##en ##zia said sponsors Sweden and Kuwait were requesting a vote on the cease ##fire plan even though they are “ ##fully aware there is no agreement on it ##” ##. The Security Council needs to reach a “ ##fe ##asi ##ble ##” agreement on a cease ##fire and not take a decision that would be “ ##pop ##uli ##stic ##” and “ ##se ##vered from reality ##” ##, he said ##.

The prison is run directly by the state ##, not a third ##- ##par ##ty private operator as in the Man ##aus prisons where the riots took place in May ##.
