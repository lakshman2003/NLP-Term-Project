[unused1] [unused2] Official dengue toll touches 80; declare epidemic, say doctors. CHENNAI: The official death figures for dengue rose to 80 on Monday with directorate of public health officials confirming 40 deaths due to dengue and an equal number due to viral haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome -triggered by dengue -since January. But senior doctors' bodies such as Indian Medical Association and Indian Public Health Association have been asking the government to declare the disease as an epidemic. A senior health official told TOI that although they have reported 11,500 cases of dengue since January, the real numbers could at least be thrice as much. "We don't want to give the full figures and cause panic. The number doesn't matter anymore. What we need is vec tor control. Declaring it an epidemic won't solve the problem," he said on the condition of anonymity. Former health director Dr S Elango said the state's decision to under-report cases was against WHO norms. Another major problem is a 60% shortage in health inspectors. The state now has just 3,500 health inspectors against the required 10,000. "Half of these 3,500 inspectors have been transferred to the post from pro grammes that have been closed. Hence, they aren't trained in vector control," said public health director Dr K Kolandasamy.

[unused1] [unused2] Blast near foreign contractor’s car in Kabul, 4 injured. Kabul, March 2. An explosion near a vehicle belonging to foreign workers left at least four people injured on Friday in eastern Kabul, an area where many expatriates reside, the Afghan interior ministry said. It was not immediately clear if the explosion was a bomb. The blast hit “an international contractor company’s car”, interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish told AFP, adding that the four wounded were all civilians. Local media showed images of damage to houses and shops in the area. If confirmed as an attack, it would be the latest to hit Kabul, which is one of the deadliest places in Afghanistan for civilians as both the Taliban and the expanding Islamic State group step up their assaults on the city. The explosion also comes just days after Afghan president Ashraf Ghani unveiled a plan for peace talks with the Taliban, including a proposal to eventually recognise them as a political party. Ghani revealed his plans in a speech during international peace talks in Kabul this week that went better than expected, with officials in Washington daring to hold out hope that the longest war in its history may be heading to a negotiated settlement. But Kabul remains on high alert, fearing further violence. Since mid-January, militants have stormed a luxury hotel, bombed a crowded street, raided a military compound and launched a suicide attack during morning rush hour in the capital, killing more than 130 people. — AFP

[unused1] [unused2] Fire destroys garment store, 3 adjacent shops in Cuttack. CUTTACK: A three-storey garment store in the busy Palamandap locality of the city was completely gutted in a blazing fire which also reduced three nearby shops to ashes on Sunday. No loss of life was reported in the mishap, nor was any one injured. The store had no fire safety equipment in place, said fire fighters. At around 11.25 am, some of the customers in the store noticed a fire - caused reportedly due to a short circuit - and alerted its staff. Salespersons and customers were immediately guided out of the showroom. People also vacated the nearby buildings as soon as word spread of the fire. The fire was so severe that 21 fire tenders and 160 personnel had to be pressed into action to douse the flames in an operation that lasted for more than five hours. Locals have claimed that property worth crores was gutted in the fire. "I was standing near the store when heavy smoke began billowing out. Within minutes, the entire three-storey store was engulfed in flames. The fire spread to the two other shops located in the neighbouring building," said Srikant Das, an eye-witness. Das said there were very few customers in the store as it had just opened. On January 4, a fire had broken out at a similar early hour in a shopping mall at Damana in Bhubaneswar. With the stretch leading up to the store encroached upon by shops, fire tenders had a tough time reaching the site. Firemen also struggled to control the flames on Sunday as the garment store was filled with inflammable materials and had no fire safety equipment in place. "The store had no fire safety licence, which is mandatory. The store is over 100 feet high but the breadth of the staircase was only 1.5 feet. Our men had to demolish walls and use hydraulic stairs to enter the structure and put out the flames," said chief fire officer Sukant Sethi. An electricity transformer is located outside the showroom - a fact that had triggered panic among many who were watching the scene from the roads. "Luckily, firemen controlled the flames before they reached the transformer, otherwise the results would have been disastrous," said Laxman Agarwal, another eye-witness. Vehicular movement on the stretch from Badambadi to Link Road was affected for hours after the mishap. Director general of fire services, B K Sharma has ordered an inquiry into the incident to find out the exact cause behind the problem.

[unused1] [unused2] Cold wave in Mysuru: Chimps get woollen blankets, big cats heaters. With a cold wave gripping the city, heaters are keeping the large- and medium-sized carnivores warm at Mysuru zoo. The drop in night temperatures has forced zoo keepers to boost the heat in the holding rooms of tigers, lions and leopards. Based on the night temperature, the room temperature of the animal holding rooms is artificially increased using heaters. Chimpanzees have been given warm material such as woollen blankets to keep warm at night. Gunny bags too have been placed inside their rooms for the smart primates to crawl inside and sleep snugly. Besides adjusting the temperature, the zoo authorities have also changed the the dietary plans of some animals to help them adjust to the fluctuating temperatures. C. Ravishankar, the zoo’s executive director, told The Hindu that the zoo veterinarians were keeping an eye on the animals. All large carnivores such as tigers, lions and leopards are not being kept in the day crawl at night and are being let inside their holding rooms. But in the case of medium-sized carnivores such as wild dogs, hyenas and wolves, the animal gets to choose between staying outdoors in the open enclosure or going inside the holding room where heaters regulate the temperature. “We have kept woollen blankets inside the holding rooms of chimps. They sleep on the clothing to keep themselves warm. And the heaters are placed outside the animal holding rooms and are switched on for a specific period of time under the supervision of the keepers,” Mr. Ravishankar said. However, over the past couple of days, the day temperatures have risen here, forcing the authorities to manage both the day and night temperatures. Water jets, which are usually operated in the summer, are being used now to keep animals such as elephants and Indian gaur cool. Water is sprayed even on deers and sambars. If the day temperature is high, water jets are opened at lion enclosures too, the director added.

The group said a woman it did not identify was killed and council member Francisco Grado was in serious condition. Patricio and council member Lucero Islava also had injuries, the statement said, but gave no details. The newspaper La Jornada published a photo of emergency workers assisting Patricio as she walked next to an ambulance and a picture of a white van resting on its roof in a desert countryside. The paper said Patricio’s left arm was broken. Patricio, a Nahua indigenous healer from Jalisco state known popularly as “Marichuy,” has been running as an independent candidate seeking to get a place on the July 1 presidential ballot. However, days before a deadline to gather some 866,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, she is well short of the requirement. — AP.

[unused1] [unused2] Srinagar gunfight ends, 2 Lashkar men killed. The nearly 30-hour-long gunfight in Srinagar city ended today with the killing of two holed up militants. The two militants were hiding in an under-construction multi-storey building at Karan Nagar after they failed to attack a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in the wee hours on Monday. The government had imposed restrictions in the old city to avoid any law and order situation during the anti-militancy operation. “The encounter concluded this afternoon. In the operation, two terrorists were killed. Their identity is being ascertained. The incriminating material we recovered from them suggests they were from the Lashkar-e-Toiba,” Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Swayam Prakash Pani said. During the encounter, one CRPF man was killed and one policeman suffered bullet injuries but his condition is stable. The IGP said the operation was carried out in the congested locality and a lot of civilian population was around. “While the operation was planned immediately, the civilian population was moved from the area and we thank the citizens of Srinagar city for cooperating with us. Because of the help of the community, we could take out the residents from the encounter site. Subsequently, a deliberate assault line was planned by the CRPF and Special Operation Group of the J&K Police. There was no collateral damage during the operation,” he said. Sources privy to the operation said the highly-trained militants were shifting from one room to another and that prolonged the operation. “We fired a number of rockets to break the walls of the building. Once we were successful in it, the militant movement was restricted and they took position on the ground floor. At 11 am, we were able to neutralise the first militant,” a security official said. The exchange of fire continued and another militant was injured. “At around 1 am, the final assault was launched inside the building and the second militant was killed an hour later,” he said. Two AK-47 rifles, eight AK-47 magazines and other war-like stores were recovered from the encounter site. A possible fidayeen attack was foiled on Monday, when an alert sentry at Karan Nagar noticed two militants armed with AK-47s and rucksacks, approaching the CRPF Battalion Headquarters at Karan Nagar. The sentry opened fire and the militants fled from the spot and took shelter in a partially constructed multi-storey building in the area. A contact with the militants was established around 10 am.

[unused1] [unused2] Strong earthquake strikes Chile. A magnitude 8.2 earthquake with a depth of 20.1 km (12.5 miles) struck Chile on 1st April 2014 at 23:46. The earthquake, upgraded by the USGS from a magnitude 8.0 to 8.2 was located 95 km (59 miles) northwest of Iquique, northern Chile. According to the USGS the earthquake was a result of thrust faulting at shallow depths near the Country’s coastline. This earthquake follows on from increased seismicity in the area over recent days with earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 and below occurring with same faulting mechanisms. 6 deaths have so far been confirmed and several injured. 300 inmates in Iquique escaped jail amongst the chaos caused by the earthquake and 131 have now returned voluntarily.

"I hate you, Chicago!" Ieva Urbietyte, a 25-year-old customer service representative, said while cleaning snow off her car in the Windy City. "Thankfully we don't have to do this all the time." Weather forecasters in Detroit warned that snowfall there could surpass one inch (2.5 cm) an hour as the system headed east. At the Argus Farm Stop in nearby Ann Arbor, Michigan, several customers arrived on skis, and store manager Laura Barch said she was eager to get into her snowshoes. "I feel like this is going to be the one day out of the year" to use them, said Barch. "This is the first real winter we've had in several years." Wind chill temperatures were expected to drop below zero Farenheit (minus 18 degree Celsius) in many areas across the upper Midwest. The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the National Weather Service said. City officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian said on Friday that the system was likely to drop another four or five inches (10 or 12.5 cm) of snow on the Midwest as it headed east toward New England. The storm could dump up to a foot (30 cm) of snow in New York state as it picks up moisture off the Great Lakes, he added. About 1,600 US flights were cancelled, with about a third of flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks airline traffic. Winter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.
[unused1] [unused2] Mount Ontake On 27th September at 11:52 JST, MountOntakesan (also known as Ontake) erupted without warning. Mount Ontake is Japan’s second highest volcano (3067m). The first historical eruption occurred in 1979 measuring a VEI 2. Between 1999 and 2007 very minor phreatic activity occurred.

[unused1] [unused2] Strong quake hits northeast Japan, no tsunami risk. A strong earthquake struck northeast of Tokyo on Wednesday but there was no fear of a tsunami, Japan’s meteorological agency said. It put the magnitude at 6.3, while the US Geological Survey measured it at 5.9. The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, 18 km north-northeast of the town of Daigo. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters, adding that no abnormalities were detected at nuclear power plants in the region. Japan sits at the junction of four tectonic plates and experiences a number of relatively violent quakes every year. But rigid building codes and strict enforcement mean even strong tremors often do little damage. A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into Japan’s northeast coast, leaving more than 18,000 people dead or missing, and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. In April two strong earthquakes hit southern Japan’s Kumamoto prefecture followed by more than 1,700 aftershocks, leaving at least 50 dead and causing widespread damage.

[unused1] [unused2] UK braced for Storm Emma as heavy snow causes chaos. content:London, February 28 . A brutal winter blast, named ‘Beast from the East’ after the direction of the winds, is set to transform into Storm Emma as the UK suffers severe travel disruptions and chaos due to heavy snow. The Meteorological Office issued a rare red warning, which indicates danger to life, in Scotland after a second day of heavy snow today. Several trains and flights have faced cancellations and delays since the start of this week, as airports around the country suspend operations to clear the snow from runways. “We are expecting quite wide impacts from (Storm) Emma when she arrives tomorrow night. We are forecasting more snow, strong winds and freezing rain which will make driving conditions extremely dangerous,” a Met Office spokesperson said. Amber warnings, calling for people to be wary, are in place in northern and eastern England, and the East Midlands, with a number of police forces warning against driving because of poor visibility and treacherous conditions, leading to crashes and stranded motorists. Four people are believed to have died in road crashes directly linked to the severe weather conditions across Britain. “The Beast from the East will tighten its grip as the week goes on. Gale-force winds and super-cooled freezing rain could turn parts of the UK into an ice rink by the weekend,” said Sara Thornton, director of digital weather service Weathertrending. “So far the north and east of the country have borne the brunt of the snow, but now the arrival of Storm Emma will bring the white stuff to millions more of us on Friday. Gales will come with the snow, bringing blizzard conditions to some southern and western parts of the UK that have so far been spared the snow,” she said. The snow has forced the closure of hundreds of schools across the UK, after overnight temperatures dropped to almost -12 degrees Celsius in some areas. There are fears that some rural communities could be cut off as power cuts and mobile phone network interruptions are expected. The army has been drafted into Lincolnshire to help emergency services, who have stepped up their official response to “critical”. There are fears that one of this winter’s longest big freezes in the UK could result in the highest death toll for 20 years. — PTI
