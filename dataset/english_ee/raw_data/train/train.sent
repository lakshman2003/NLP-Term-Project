[unused1] [unused2] Palestinian on boat from Gaza killed by Israeli fire: Army A Palestinian was killed Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on a boat from the Gaza Strip after it left a zone where Israel allows Palestinians to fish, officials said. A spokeswoman for the Israeli army said the boat “deviated from the designated fishing zone in the northern Gaza Strip.” Naval forces called on the boat to halt, then fired warning shots in the air before shooting toward it when the three people on board did not stop, the spokeswoman said. A severely wounded Palestinian later died from his injuries, she said. The other two Palestinian “suspects” were detained by security forces.

Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, run by Islamist movement Hamas, have fought three wars since 2008 and the territory has been under an Israeli blockade for more than 10 years. Fishing off the northern part of the strip, adjacent to Israel, is limited to six nautical miles offshore and the Israeli navy regularly fires warning shots or at Palestinians who breach it. Such incidents rarely result in deaths. Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif Qanoua called the incident “an ugly crime the occupation is responsible for and a form of continuing aggression against our Palestinian people.” The Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt has also been largely closed in recent years.

Around 25 Maoists, including women, attacked the Masudan railway station in Bihar’s Munger district, torched its signalling panel and abducted Mukesh Kumar, an assistant station master and a porter late on Tuesday night. The two were released on Wednesday evening, 16 hours after the abduction even as police, the CRPF and other paramilitary personnel mounted a massive search for them. Issues threat Rajesh Kumar, chief public relations officer (CPRO) of East-Central Railway said the incident disrupted movement of trains on the Kiul-Jamalpur section of the division for several hours, causing inconvenience to passengers. Later, the Maoists called the railway control room in Malda through the abducted ASM, and threatened to kill the captives, “if trains are allowed to ply on the Kiul-Jamalpur section.” Many trains were diverted through Jhajha and Barauni and some services were curtailed, said the official. Both the captives were released at Jagdishpur in Lakhisarai district, neighbouring Munger. The Maoists had earlier called a 48-hour bandh in Bihar and Jharkhand to protest “Operation Greenhunt.” “A joint team of the Central Reserve Police Force, Sashastra Seema Bal and the special task force of the Bihar police launched a hunt in the forest and hilly areas for the Maoists involved in the attack and abduction,” Additional Director General of Police Sanjiv Kumar Singhal told The Hindu.

[unused1] [unused2] Fire rages at civil supplies godown in Madurai, none hurt MADURAI: A fire broke out at a Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation warehouse at Kappalur here on Thursday evening, but no one was injured. The fire was first reported to the Thirumangalam fire station at 4.15pm. Sensing that it could quickly spread, an alert was sounded. Vehicles from these stations rushed to Kappalur and the city corporation too rushed its water tanker trucks to the spot. "We received the call at 4.15pm and reached the spot quickly.

[unused1] [unused2] Bangladesh: 250 fall sick after toxic gas leak at fertiliser unit About 250 people, including children, have fallen sick and hundreds of residents have been evacuated from their homes after a toxic gas leak from a fertiliser unit in Bangladesh’s port city of Chittagong, officials said on Tuesday. Di-ammonium phosphate (DPA) leaked from the DAP Fertiliser Company Limited on the bank of Karnaphuli river on Monday night and firefighters battled until late morning to plug the leakage. DPA is one of a series of water-soluble ammonium phosphate salts that can be produced when ammonia reacts with phosphoric acid. Reports quoting officials said one of the gas tanks with 500 tonne capacity leaked at around 11:30 PM last night. The gas quickly spread across large parts of the city. Strong winds blew the gas across a 10-kilometre radius and reports suggested that people felt breathing problems at the southern city’s international airport. “The gas spread from the unit causing breathing problems to the people across several kilometres,” officer-in-charge of the nearby police station said. Of the nearly 250 taken ill, 56 people, including more than 10 children, were admitted to hospitals in the port city. All the people being treated were stated be out of danger. Hundreds of residents were evacuated from their homes near the plant, police and fire officials said. “Several people reported to doctors just because of panic,” the city’s civil surgeon Azizur Rahman Siddique said. Chittagong’s Deputy Commissioner Mesbahuddin Ahmed said the situation was under control as leakage has been plugged. The reason behind the leak could not be known immediately. Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), which runs the unit, formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident, while the district administration has formed a three-member panel to probe the leak. At the time of the incident, the amount of ammonia in the air was recorded at 600ppm (parts per million) whilst workers at the factory can tolerate conditions with ammonia gas up to 25ppm, the environment department said. Experts said exposure to ammonia could cause slackening, vomiting and breathing problems. “I have been informed that the fire service men nearly brought under control the situation,” Chittagong’s deputy commissioner Mesbahuddin Ahmed said.

[unused1] [unused2] Deadly blizzard hits US east coast, 9 killed A life-threatening blizzard expected to dump a record 30 inches of snow on the US capital slammed the east coast today, leaving at least nine persons dead nationwide and causing 10 states to declare a state of emergency. Officials urged millions of people in the storm’s path to seek shelter and brace for a weekend of travel disruptions. The states most hit by the blizzard were Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Kentucky, in addition to Washington DC, which has declared a “snow emergency.” In Virginia, which has a large Telugu population, media reported several weather-related accidents yesterday. Virginia State Police responded to more than 800 traffic accidents. In a statement, the North American Telugu Association urged members to stay indoors and take precautions for safety. A number of temples and other places of worship, including gurdwaras, in the region have opened up to shelter people. Up to 85 million people — about one quarter of the US population — were in the path of the storm that has iced up much of the East Coast and the Mid-Atlantic. At least nine people have died, reports said. Latest estimates suggest more than 120,000 homes have been left without electricity as the storm, dubbed “Snowzilla” by some US media, began dumping several inches of snow across the region. Governors in at least 10 American states have declared states of emergency while Washington is likely to be covered under 30 inches of snow over the weekend, in what could be a record snowfall. “We have a forecast that we did not have in 90 years. It has life-and-death implication, and all the residents of the District of Columbia should treat it that way,” Washington DC Mayor Miriel E Bowser said. He said District National Guard has been deployed. Local governments have deployed hundreds of plows and salt trucks to clear out snow on roads and highways. With temperatures below the freezing point, people stayed indoors and found shelters to keep warm. Unlike a normal Friday night, most of the downtowns, malls and restaurants were deserted and hardly any traffic was seen on the road. More than 6,000 flights were canceled between yesterday and today and over 4,500 delayed. As a precaution, the public transport system have been shut down in the Washington region. “The combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds will produce whiteout conditions and extremely dangerous travel,” the National Weather Service (NWS) said. NWS officials said the storm could cause more than USD 1 billion in damage. The blizzard is expected to last about 36 hours and leave more than two feet of snow in some places. In a tweet, the service said “the real teeth” of the storm would be felt midnight through the afternoon today. “Heavy snow, increasing winds, lightning threat,” it warned. Officials throughout the Mid-Atlantic region warned that it could be days, or even a week, before residents will be able to dig out.

[unused1] [unused2] Earthquake of 5.9 magnitude rocks southern Mexico; no damage reported yet A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck southern Mexico early on Monday, sending frightened residents into the streets as seismic alarms echoed across the capital, although there were no immediate reports of damage. The quake hit 32 km (20 miles) east of Santa Catarina Mechoacan in the state of Oaxaca at a depth of 40 km at 12.57 am (0657 GMT), the US Geological Survey said, revising its strength down slightly from an initial 6.1 magnitude. The tremor was strong enough to trigger earthquake alarms in Mexico City, more than 200 miles (320 km) away, but was shorter and less intense than one on Friday in the same area that damaged about 1,000 houses. Many in Mexico City slept through the shaking. Residents who rushed into the streets when the alarms sounded quickly returned to their homes once the quake stopped. The head of Mexico’s civil protection agency, Luis Felipe Puente, said state emergency procedures had been activated in the affected states. “So far, no damage has been reported,” he said on Twitter. Infrastructure, including installations of state oil company Pemex, were intact, he said. Mexico has suffered a series of more powerful earthquakes in recent months, including two in September that together killed hundreds of people and brought buildings crashing down.
[unused1] [unused2] Iran plane crash: No survivors, bodies buried in snow as wreckage found on mountain There were no survivors among the 65 passengers and crew on an Iranian plane that ploughed into a mountain top, where most of the bodies lie buried under snow, the first rescue team to reach the wreckage said on Tuesday. The Aseman Airlines plane disappeared from radar screens 50 minutes into Sunday’s flight from Tehran to the southwestern city of Yasuj. Iranian military located the wreckage in the central province of Isfahan on Tuesday morning. “Only parts of the airplane are visible and the rest is deeply buried... The rescue team have seen 30 bodies on the ground,” an official from Iran’s Red Crescent was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. The remaining passengers and crew were buried under the snow, the official said. “The plane had hit top of the mountain before crashing 30 metres (100 feet) further down,” the pilot of a rescue helicopter told state television. Glacial temperatures and the mountainous terrain hampered search and rescue efforts, adding to the grief and anger felt by families of the victims in a society plagued by risky air travel where officials blame decades of sanctions for the poor state of national fleet. The twin-engined turboprop ATR 72 that crashed was over 24 years old. According to data cited by the Flight Safety Foundation’s aviation-safety.net website, it was restored to service just three months ago after being in storage for six years. More than 100 people demonstrated on Monday outside a local government office in nearby Dena Kooh county, demanding officials step down for their handling of the disaster after announcements that wreckage had been found on Monday were then denied. A video on Tasnim showed an angry man shouting “Would you have flown on the same plane?” at Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi. Revolutionary Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif told state television the wreckage was eventually spotted by a military drone. After a long wait to locate the plane, relatives will have to endure further delays until the bodies are returned as helicopters are unable to land in the hostile terrain and the work will have to be carried out on foot, an emergency service official said. Iran has suffered several plane crashes in recent decades. Tehran blames U.S. sanctions for preventing it from importing new aircraft or spare parts. A Boeing 727 crashed in northwest Iran in 2011, killing 78 people, and in 2009 all 168 people on board died when a Caspian Airlines Tupolev crashed en route for Armenia. In 2003 an Ilyushin-76 troop carrier crashed in southeast Iran, killing all 276 Revolutionary Guard soldiers and crew. A deal with world powers on Tehran’s nuclear programme in 2015 opened the way for Iranian airlines to update their fleets but many older planes are still in service, particularly on domestic routes

The magnitude 6.5 quake struck at 11:47pm on Friday and was felt across the island, including about 200 kilometers (124 miles) away in the capital Jakarta, where office towers and apartment buildings swayed. Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places. Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes, cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami. Ahmad Solihin, a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region, said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home. He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming, he said. "People suddenly started running so I joined them," said Solihin. More than 1,000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didn't return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe, he said. A 62-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman were killed in building collapses, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. Damage was heaviest in the Tasikmalaya, Pangandaran and Ciamis regions of West Java Province near the epicenter. More than 40 houses collapsed and about 65 suffered severe damage, said Nugroho. The earthquake was about 91 kilometers (56 miles) deep and located just inland, the US Geological Survey said. It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Java's coastline that was lifted about two hours later. No significant waves were reported. Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated. Indonesia sits on the "Pacific Ring of Fire" and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Officers said the driver hit the children at speed as he was driving away from another location close to the school, where his vehicle had brushed against a pedestrian. The incident took place in Muzaffarpur district, around 43 miles (70 kilometres) from the state capital Patna. "Eyewitnesses have told us that the driver didn't stop even after running over these middle-school children," Anil Kumar Singh, deputy inspector general of Bihar police told AFP. "His car overturned after the accident and he ran away from the spot. We are still looking for him," he said. The 20 injured children have been admitted to hospital, he added. India has some of the world's deadliest roads. At least 12 children aged between seven and 14 were killed in northern Uttar Pradesh state last January after their schoolbus collided with a truck. More than 150,000 people are killed each year with most accidents blamed on poor roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.
[unused1] [unused2] Official dengue toll touches 80; declare epidemic, say doctors. CHENNAI: The official death figures for dengue rose to 80 on Monday with directorate of public health officials confirming 40 deaths due to dengue and an equal number due to viral haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome -triggered by dengue -since January. But senior doctors' bodies such as Indian Medical Association and Indian Public Health Association have been asking the government to declare the disease as an epidemic. A senior health official told TOI that although they have reported 11,500 cases of dengue since January, the real numbers could at least be thrice as much. "We don't want to give the full figures and cause panic. The number doesn't matter anymore. What we need is vec tor control. Declaring it an epidemic won't solve the problem," he said on the condition of anonymity. Former health director Dr S Elango said the state's decision to under-report cases was against WHO norms. Another major problem is a 60% shortage in health inspectors. The state now has just 3,500 health inspectors against the required 10,000. "Half of these 3,500 inspectors have been transferred to the post from pro grammes that have been closed. Hence, they aren't trained in vector control," said public health director Dr K Kolandasamy.

About 7 kg explosives may have been used. The bodies were charred beyond recognition. Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said preliminary reports indicated that it was a bomb blast. An eyewitness who was travelling in an autorickshaw said he heard a loud explosion and blacked out. Another eyewitness said bodies were scattered and more than 10 were seen at the site.

[unused1] [unused2] Large eruption at Mount Kelut forces evacuation. 2 people have been killed and over 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from the vicinity of Mount Kelut (Kelud) after it erupted explosively on 13th February at around 23:29 (local time). Since the beginning of January 2014 there had been an increase in both shallow and deep volcanogenic earthquakes along with an increase in water temperature at the crater lake, leading to the alert level being raised to 3 (out of 4) and a 5km restriction zone around the crater. Approximately 90 minutes before the alert was raised to 4, the volcano erupted resulting in the explosion being heard 125 miles (200 km) away and an ash column reaching 30 km into the atmosphere. Over 200,000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles (10 km) from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya, Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick. Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles (130 km) away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick. The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths. Just a few centimetres of ash can cause roofs to collapse especially poorly constructed ones made of weak material. Kelut, also known as Kelud is a 1731 metres stratovolcano located on the island of Java. Eruptions have dated back to 230 BCE and the volcano has had episodes of eruptions as large as a VEI 4 since then. A VEI 4 eruption in 1919 lead to the death of over 5000 people and another VEI 4 eruption in February 1990 lead to the death of more than 30 people.

[unused1] [unused2] Mount Ontake On 27th September at 11:52 JST, MountOntakesan (also known as Ontake) erupted without warning. Mount Ontake is Japan’s second highest volcano (3067m). The first historical eruption occurred in 1979 measuring a VEI 2. Between 1999 and 2007 very minor phreatic activity occurred. This year’s eruption was phreatic in nature and followed on from seismic tremor and uplift which were detected just 11 minutes before the eruption. The eruption measured a VEI 3. According the Global Vocalism Program, there was a temporary increase in seismic activity near the summit between 10th and11th September and on the 14th September low frequency signals were detected. The eruption on the 27th ejected an ash plume which reached heights 7 to 10km and ash fall affected the area in the vicinity, measuring 50cm in thickness around the crater. The deadly pyroclastic flow which was responsible for the fatalities travelled 3km down the south flank of the volcano. 57 fatalities occurred, 70 were injured and a further 6 are still missing.

[unused1] [unused2] Huge fire burns down plastic godown near Mumbai; no injuries reported Fire broke out in a godown near Shil Phata, near Mumbra, a little after midnight on Tuesday. The flames spread rapidly within the godown because it was used to store inflammable plastic materials, and took more than two hours to douse, officials said. There have been no casualties. Shil Phata is located around 29km from Mumbai city. The Thane Municipal Corporation’s Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC) received a call about the fire around 12.30am from locals living near the godown, which is located inside Khan Compound.“The workers staying beside the godown reported the fire. Within 20 to 25 minutes, the RDMC team reached the spot with four fire engines and four water tankers,” said Santosh Kadam from the RDMC. “The godown was used to store plastic granules and the fire was huge, so it took two hours to douse it, after which cooling operations began and continued for 90 minutes,” Kadam said. “The fire could have started because of a short circuit,” he added. The godown is spread over one and half acres of land, and was filled with plastic granules, which were cleared using JCBs and Quick Response Vehicles, which were called to the spot, to prevent the fire from spreading. The police are now investigating to establish the source of the fire.
[unused1] [unused2] 21 Maoists killed in Malkangiri shootout Police commandos gunned down 21 Maoists in an exchange of fire in Malkangiri forest area on the border of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh early on Monday, a top police officer here said. Police suspect that at least two top leaders, each with a reward of Rs 20 lakh on his head, were among those killed. Sources said Gajarla Ravi aka Uday, and Chalapati, both high-ranking leaders, were suspected to be among those killed. Andhra Pradesh’s police chief, Nanduri Sambasiva Rao who left for Visakhapatnam immediately upon receiving news of the encounter, confirmed the Naxal casualties to PTI. Odisha’s police chief, K.B. Singh, said the commandos acted on a tip-off that around 30 rebels had gathered close to the border with Andhra Pradesh. According to Andhra Pradesh Police, two constables of the Greyhounds, an elite anti-Maoist force, were injured in the encounter, which occurred during a routine combing operation being jointly carried out by police of both the states at Ramgurha in Malkangiri district of Odisha. One of the commandos, Abubacker, died later in the King George Hospital here. The face-off between the security personnel and the outlaws lasted for about an hour. Some women Maoists were also said to be among those killed. The injured constables were shifted for treatment to the King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam by helicopter. Police have recovered four AK-47 rifles from the scene of the encounter. Sambasiva Rao said combing operation would continue as there was information that there were some more Maoists roaming in the region. Police recovered four AK-47 and self-loading rifles from the scene of the encounter, where a Maoist den was also found. ”A large haul of weapons like AK47s and SLRs indicates clearly that it is a case where state level leaders could be present. Unless we identify them, we can't exactly tell who is there,” Sambasiva Rao, AP’s director general of police, said.

[unused1] [unused2] 20 children among 100 killed as Syria attacks rebels in Eastern Ghouta Heavy Syrian bombardment killed at least 100 civilians in rebel-held eastern Ghouta on Monday, a war monitor said, as regime forces appeared to prepare for an imminent ground assault. The escalation came as pro-government forces were also expected to enter the northern Kurdish-controlled enclave of Afrin, to take a stand against a month-old Turkish assault there. Held by rebels since 2012, Eastern Ghouta is the last opposition pocket around Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad has dispatched reinforcements there in an apparent concerted effort to retake it. A barrage of air strikes, rocket fire and artillery slammed into several towns across Eastern Ghouta on Monday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 children were among 100 civilians killed in the assault, while around 300 other people were wounded. “The regime is bombing Eastern Ghouta to pave the way for a ground offensive,” said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. The main opposition National Coalition, which is based in Turkey, denounced the “war of extermination” in Eastern Ghouta as well as the “international silence”. In a statement, it also accused regime ally Russia of seeking to “bury the political process” for a solution to the conflict. Residents of Hammuriyeh could be seen rushing indoors in panic as soon as they heard the sound of airplanes. Alaa al-Din, a 23-year-old Syrian in Hammuriyeh, said civilians were afraid of a potential government offensive. “Ghouta’s fate is unknown. We’ve got nothing but God’s mercy and hiding out in our basements,” he told AFP. “There’s no alternative.” Wailing children Shelling also hit the town of Douma, where an AFP correspondent saw five toddlers brought to a hospital, covered in dust and wailing uncontrollably. The hospital was full of distraught civilians: one father slapped his forehead after finding his two dead children, another erupted into tears as he discovered the body of his newborn on a purple sheet next to a pool of blood. Eastern Ghouta is held by two main Islamist factions, while jihadists control small pockets including one directly adjacent to the capital. The Observatory and Syrian daily newspaper Al-Watan had said negotiations were under way for the evacuation of jihadists from Eastern Ghouta. But escalating military pressure indicate that the regime would opt for a ground assault instead of talks, the monitor said. Government troops carried out a relentless five-day bombing campaign earlier this month that killed around 250 civilians in the enclave and wounded hundreds. Around the same time, the monitor said, the regime began dispatching military reinforcements to Eastern Ghouta. After days of relative calm, the government sent more than 260 rockets sailing onto Eastern Ghouta on Sunday. Those rockets, as well as artillery fire and air strikes, killed 17 civilians, said the Observatory. The regime is keen to regain control of Eastern Ghouta to halt the deadly salvo of rockets and mortars that rebels fire on Damascus. About half a dozen rockets hit the capital Sunday night, AFP correspondents said. State news agency SANA reported that one person was killed. More than 20 civilians have been killed by rebel fire this month alone in regime-held Damascus. Regime to enter Afrin? All was quiet in the capital on Monday but since rumours of an imminent assault on Eastern Ghouta started spreading, people living close to the rebel enclave started packing their bags. Jawad al-Obros, 30, said he was looking to move to a hotel in the western sector of the city to escape his home in an east Damascus neighbourhood that has been regularly hit by rockets from Ghouta. “We’re tired of this situation. It seems that there’s no solution but a full-blown military one,” he told AFP. More than 340,000 people have been killed since Syria’s conflict erupted in 2011 with protests against Assad’s government. It has since evolved into a war that has carved up the country into rival zones of influence among the regime, rebels, jihadists and Kurdish forces. The Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) control the northwestern region of Afrin, target of a month-old assault by the Turkish army and allied Syrian rebels. Turkey sees the YPG as a “terror” group linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), outlawed by Ankara, and wants to clear it from its southern border. The YPG has controlled Afrin since 2012, when Syrian troops withdrew from it and other Kurdish-majority areas. Syrian state media said Monday that pro-regime forces were preparing to enter the area to “join the resistance against the Turkish aggression”. Turkey warned against any bid by the Syrian regime to help the YPG. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke on the phone with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and, according to Turkish media, told him any support from Damascus to the YPG in Afrin “will have consequences” for the regime.
[unused1] [unused2] Driver killed, 44 injured as bus ploughs into mini-truck in Ghaziabad GHAZIABAD: The driver of a Rajasthan Roadways bus was killed and 44 others were injured when the bus ploughed into the rear of a mini-truck on Meerut Road in Ghaziabad on Sunday. Seven of the seriously injured have been referred to a hospital in Delhi. The accident took place ahead of an eatery near Vardhmanpuram police outpost on Meerut Road, an erstwhile stretch of NH-58, around 4am when most passengers were asleep. The victim has been identified as Babu Lal Saini (50), driver of the ill-fated bus that belonged to Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation. The front portion of the bus was badly damaged. According to police, there were 48 passengers in the bus which was on its way to Haridwar. The bus conductor, Mahipal Singh, who has been admitted to Combined Hospital in Sanjay Nagar, told TOI that the bus had started from Jalore depot in Rajasthan at around 8.45am on Saturday. “We had crossed 33 halts till Delhi-UP border. There was no stop in Ghaziabad and we were expected to reach Haridwar by 7.30 am. A driver, Surajmal, had driven the bus from Jalore to Jaipur. Babu Lal Saini, the driver who has been killed, took over from Surajmal when the bus left Jaipur at 8.05 am. Most of the passengers were sleeping and therefore had no idea as to how exactly the accident took place. I was sleeping on my seat and probably passed out when the accident took place. When I regained my consciousness, I was being hauled inside an ambulance by cops. I have a fracture on my left leg and injuries in my hip region,” Singh told TOI. Investigations are underway to find the exact cause of the accident. “The mini-truck driver, Netrapal, was questioned. He said he applied sudden brakes when a vehicle travelling from Meerut to Ghaziabad suddenly took a U-turn through a cut on the road divider right in front of his vehicle. The bus, which was on a high speed, probably crashed into the rear of the mini-truck at this point of time. The truck was on its way from Loni to Meerut,” local police outpost in-charge Balram Yadav said. The police are trying to figure out whether the driver of the mini-truck had parked his vehicle on the road that could have led to the accident. According to police, a total of 44 persons were injured including 22 men, 19 women and three kids. The driver and 28 passengers were taken to Sanjay Nagar Combined Hospital. “The driver had been brought dead to the hospital. Two of the 28 passengers were serious with head injuries. We referred them to GTB Hospital in Delhi. The other patients are stable. Some of them have also been relieved from the hospital,” chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Sanjay Nagar Hospital, Dr Dinesh Sharma told TOI. The police rushed 16 passengers to MMG Hospital. “Five were immediately referred to GTB Hospital in Delhi as they were critical. Family members of two other passengers also wanted better treatment. So they too were taken to GTB Hospital. Four patients shifted to other hospitals out of their own volition. Five patients are at present admitted but they are stable,” said the CMS of MMG Hospital, Dr Jitendra Tyagi. The police have registered an FIR in Muradnagar police station under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (causing death due to negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering the life of others) of IPC. The mini-truck bearing a Haryana registration number has been seized. “We rushed the passengers immediately to hospitals in whatever vehicles we had at the police station. The truck driver, Netrapal, has been arrested. Till now we have not been able to ascertain which vehicle was at bigger fault . The bus seemed to be travelling at a high speed too,” SHO, Muradnagar, Ranveer Singh told TOI.

[unused1] [unused2] Tibet earthquake caused Brahmaputra's turbidity: China BEIJING: China on Wednesday said a 6.9-magnitude earthquake in Tibet in mid-November had caused turbidity in the Brahmaputra waters, which had sparked concerns in India.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying also said the recent tests showed that the water quality met the standards of Class III water. Class III is generally regarded as good for fish regeneration and wildlife. Earlier, media reports spoke of heavy pollution in the Brahmaputra river known as Siang river in Arunachal Pradesh. Some media outlets quoted reports of formation of barrier lakes in Tibet close to Arunachal Pradesh which has sparked concerns of a possible deluge in the downstream. "We have noted that Indian media recently made a series of reports on this issue. They said China was conducting water conservancy project or exploiting a mine previously whereas now claim there is a barrier lake upstream," Hua said. "I could tell you responsibly that none of these speculations is true according to the results of the investigation by the relevant Chinese authorities," she told PTI in response to a question. She said the 6.9-magnitude earthquake in mid-November hit the area near Mainling County in Tibet, "which might have lead to the turbidity in the middle and lower reaches of the river for a certain period of time". "After the earthquake, we monitored the water quality of the Yarlung Zangbo (Chinese name for Brahmaputra) River and the results showed that it met the standards of Class III water," she said. At the same time, she stressed that the investigation done by China is "utterly for humanitarian considerations and does not affect its stance on the border issue." China claims Arunachal Pradesh as Southern Tibet. Hua yesterday said that China will maintain communication with India to deal with massive lakes formed by on the following the earthquake, which caused concerns of a sudden flooding on the Indian side. She said verification by the relevant Chinese authorities revealed that the lake is to the "eastern section of the India-China boundary". "It is caused by natural factors. It is not a manmade accident. I noticed that Indian professional authorise have made an analysis and clarified," she said, referring to reports that the lakes were formed by the landslides. China hopes that the Indian media will not make a groundless speculation on this, she added.
[unused1] [unused2] Srinagar gunfight ends, 2 Lashkar men killed. The nearly 30-hour-long gunfight in Srinagar city ended today with the killing of two holed up militants. The two militants were hiding in an under-construction multi-storey building at Karan Nagar after they failed to attack a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in the wee hours on Monday. The government had imposed restrictions in the old city to avoid any law and order situation during the anti-militancy operation. “The encounter concluded this afternoon. In the operation, two terrorists were killed. Their identity is being ascertained. The incriminating material we recovered from them suggests they were from the Lashkar-e-Toiba,” Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Swayam Prakash Pani said. During the encounter, one CRPF man was killed and one policeman suffered bullet injuries but his condition is stable. The IGP said the operation was carried out in the congested locality and a lot of civilian population was around. “While the operation was planned immediately, the civilian population was moved from the area and we thank the citizens of Srinagar city for cooperating with us. Because of the help of the community, we could take out the residents from the encounter site. Subsequently, a deliberate assault line was planned by the CRPF and Special Operation Group of the J&K Police. There was no collateral damage during the operation,” he said. Sources privy to the operation said the highly-trained militants were shifting from one room to another and that prolonged the operation. “We fired a number of rockets to break the walls of the building. Once we were successful in it, the militant movement was restricted and they took position on the ground floor. At 11 am, we were able to neutralise the first militant,” a security official said. The exchange of fire continued and another militant was injured. “At around 1 am, the final assault was launched inside the building and the second militant was killed an hour later,” he said. Two AK-47 rifles, eight AK-47 magazines and other war-like stores were recovered from the encounter site. A possible fidayeen attack was foiled on Monday, when an alert sentry at Karan Nagar noticed two militants armed with AK-47s and rucksacks, approaching the CRPF Battalion Headquarters at Karan Nagar. The sentry opened fire and the militants fled from the spot and took shelter in a partially constructed multi-storey building in the area. A contact with the militants was established around 10 am.
[unused1] [unused2] Fire at open dump on first floor of Haryana secretariat CHANDIGARH: Old furniture and other waste dumped in an open area on the first floor of Haryana civil secretariat building in Sector 1 caught fire on Thursday morning. No loss of office records, property or lives was reported. However, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) canteen adjoining the dumped material suffered damages. The fire and emergency services wing of the municipal corporation received a call at 9.08am. The department pressed three tenders into service from sectors 11 and 17 fire stations. The firemen managed to douse the flames in half an hour, but since the dumped material had pieces of cloths and wood, the area remained engulfed in thick smoke, which cleared after more than two hours. The 1.5 lakh litre water tank of the secretariat proved to be of great help to the firemen, as it constantly provided water to all three vehicles, which didn’t have to go back for a refill. CISF canteen’s goods, like salt, oil and pulses, among other things, was burnt and its temporary wall was demolished to throw water on the flames, sources said. “Quick action helped control the blaze. We used the water tank situated there. As smoke engulfed the area, we had the fire tenders on standby for over two hours. No loss of record or human life was reported. There was though damage to the CISF canteen,” said ML Sharma, MC station fire officer.

[unused1] [unused2] Fire destroys garment store, 3 adjacent shops in Cuttack. CUTTACK: A three-storey garment store in the busy Palamandap locality of the city was completely gutted in a blazing fire which also reduced three nearby shops to ashes on Sunday. No loss of life was reported in the mishap, nor was any one injured. The store had no fire safety equipment in place, said fire fighters. At around 11.25 am, some of the customers in the store noticed a fire - caused reportedly due to a short circuit - and alerted its staff. Salespersons and customers were immediately guided out of the showroom. People also vacated the nearby buildings as soon as word spread of the fire. The fire was so severe that 21 fire tenders and 160 personnel had to be pressed into action to douse the flames in an operation that lasted for more than five hours. Locals have claimed that property worth crores was gutted in the fire. "I was standing near the store when heavy smoke began billowing out. Within minutes, the entire three-storey store was engulfed in flames. The fire spread to the two other shops located in the neighbouring building," said Srikant Das, an eye-witness. Das said there were very few customers in the store as it had just opened. On January 4, a fire had broken out at a similar early hour in a shopping mall at Damana in Bhubaneswar. With the stretch leading up to the store encroached upon by shops, fire tenders had a tough time reaching the site. Firemen also struggled to control the flames on Sunday as the garment store was filled with inflammable materials and had no fire safety equipment in place. "The store had no fire safety licence, which is mandatory. The store is over 100 feet high but the breadth of the staircase was only 1.5 feet. Our men had to demolish walls and use hydraulic stairs to enter the structure and put out the flames," said chief fire officer Sukant Sethi. An electricity transformer is located outside the showroom - a fact that had triggered panic among many who were watching the scene from the roads. "Luckily, firemen controlled the flames before they reached the transformer, otherwise the results would have been disastrous," said Laxman Agarwal, another eye-witness. Vehicular movement on the stretch from Badambadi to Link Road was affected for hours after the mishap. Director general of fire services, B K Sharma has ordered an inquiry into the incident to find out the exact cause behind the problem.
[unused1] [unused2] Tonga declares state of emergency as Cyclone Gita intensifies. Nuku’alofa: Tonga declared a state of emergency on Monday as a powerful cyclone bears down on the Pacific island nation after wreaking havoc in neighbouring Samoa. Acting Prime Minister Semisi Sika issued the nationwide alert, saying he was "satisfied that an emergency is happening or is about to happen in the kingdom". Severe Tropical Cyclone Gita is intensifying as it approaches and the Fiji Meteorological Service predicted it will become a maximum category five storm before reaching Tonga on Monday night. It is already packing wind gusts of 220 kmh (137 mph) as it gathers strength some 370 kilometres east of Tonga's most populous island Tongatapu. Tonga's Fua'amotu Weather Forecasting Centre warned residents could expect "very destructive hurricane force winds". Gita slammed into Samoa overnight Friday, forcing the evacuation of some 200 people and causing widespread flooding, leaving many without power and electricity. Tonga's information ministry said evacuation centres were being prepared across the kingdom and advised residents to avoid unnecessary travel. "Every family should have an emergency kit packed in their homes," it said. "Everyone should be mindful of what might cause damage within their homes such as large trees that can potentially damage a house." Cyclones are common in the Pacific at this time of year, with top-of-the-scale category five systems proving highly destructive when they make landfall. Cyclone Winston killed 44 people in Fiji in 2016 and Cyclone Pam claimed 11 lives and damaged 65,000 homes in Vanuatu in 2015.
[unused1] [unused2] Curfew in Jaipur after scuffle escalates, 1 killed Curfew was clamped in parts of the walled city of Jaipur after one person was killed and four policemen were injured late Friday night after a traffic scuffle escalated into a full-blown conflict between police and residents of the Muslim-majority Ramganj locality. The district administration has suspended mobile Internet services for two days – from 6 am on Saturday to 11.59 pm Sunday – to check rumours from spreading. Trouble started at about 8:30 pm on Friday, when a police constable, during a routine clearing of street vendors, allegedly hit a Muslim couple – local resident Sajid and his wife – who were passing by on a bike. “We were just passing by when the policemen stopped us. Then, a constable swung his baton and hit our bike. My husband was hit on his hand and my little daughter fell off the bike. I tried to stop the constable but he pushed me aside,” Sajid’s wife told local news channels outside the police station. The incident led to a heated verbal exchange, after which the couple reached the Ramganj police station. “It was a minor scuffle and while the policemen were talking to the couple, a crowd gathered outside the station. They started pelting stones and engaged in vandalism and arson. Police used light force to disperse them by firing tear gas shells and shots in the air. One Mohammad Raees alias Adil was injured and taken to SMS Hospital in the city, where he passed away at about 1 am,” Police Commissioner Sanjay Agarwal told The Sunday Express, adding, “The cause of his death will be ascertained only after we have the postmortem report.” Agarwal said four policemen were also injured and were rushed to the trauma centre of the hospital. One of them, he said, was seriously injured. “The situation is under control now. Our teams are patrolling the area and peace committee meetings are being held to restore normalcy,” he said. While police claimed they had to use force because the mob had turned unruly, Muslim organisations said police used excessive force without giving the crowd a chance to disperse. “Police did not even wait for the crowd to disperse after the lathicharge. Eyewitnesses told us they only fired two-three tear gas shells and then started firing. Also, they could have fired in the air or aimed at the protesters’ legs. Adil died from a bullet wound on his chest,” Mohd Iqbal Siddiqi, spokesperson of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind said. Areas under the Ramganj, Manak Chowk, Subhash Chowk and Galta Gate police stations remained under curfew from 2 am late Friday night to 8 pm on Saturday, after several vehicles were set ablaze by the mob.
[unused1] [unused2] 3 soldiers, 2 cops die in Kupwara; 5 ultras shot Kupwara, March 21 The nearly 48-hour gunbattle in the dense Halmatpora Chak forests of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district ended on Wednesday night, with five security personnel — three Army jawans and two policemen from the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police — and an equal number of militants killed in one of the deadliest operations in the Valley so far this year. Six security personnel were injured. The police described their condition as “stable”. The encounter broke out about 8 km from the Line of Control (LoC) on Tuesday morning after a police patrol intercepted a group of militants. A joint team of the Kupwara police along with companies of the Army, the Territorial Army (TA) and the Central Reserve Police Force were engaged in the operation. The Lashkar-e-Toiba militants managed to sneak in, crossing two ridges of the Shamsabari mountain range. They reportedly met their “reception party” (overground workers and militants in the Valley) on crossing the LoC, and were proceeding towards Kupwara when spotted by a police patrol, officials said. Hiding inside a mosque, two of them were killed on Tuesday as they ran towards the forest area. Another militant, who had positioned himself at a height and was firing on approaching security personnel, was killed later in the evening. The security forces eliminated two more militants in the Halmatpora Chak forests on Wednesday. With the bodies of the militants yet to be retrieved from the encounter site, their identities have not been ascertained so far. The deceased security personnel were identified as Deepak Thusoo, Ashraf Rather, SPO Mohd Yousuf, Sepoy Ashraf Rather of 160 TA and Naik Ranjeet Kholka of 5 Bihar. Sources said additional reinforcements were rushed to eliminate the militants, but the militants, hiding in the forest area, kept changing their location while firing at the forces, prolonging the gunbattle. The Army then deployed its elite paratroopers to step up the offensive.
[unused1] [unused2] Puerto Rico population to drop 14% after Hurricane Maria wreckage Puerto Rico’s population is set to decrease by 14 per cent to 2.9 million inhabitants by 2019 due to an exodus of residents fleeing the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in September, a study has found. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York estimated in a report released last month that about 114,000 to 213,000 Puerto Rican residents will leave the island annually “as a result of Hurricane Maria.” Between 2017 and 2019, the US territory stands to lose 470,335 residents, it added. “In the decade prior to Hurricane Maria, net migration from Puerto Rico to the United States amounted to approximately half a million, which represented a loss of ten percent of the island’s population,” said report authors Edwin Melendez and Jennifer Hinojosa. “In other words, Puerto Rico will lose the same population in a span of a couple of years after Hurricane Maria as the island lost during a prior decade of economic stagnation.” Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have fled to the mainland since Maria struck on September 20, devastating the island, just two weeks after Hurricane Irma tore through the Caribbean. The vast majority went to Florida and New York, which already had around one million Puerto Ricans each. Around 700,000 Puerto Ricans live in New York City. Overall, there are five million Puerto Ricans on the US mainland, compared to 3.4 million on the island. Melendez and Hinojosa estimate that between 40,000 and 82,000 people will migrate to Florida each year from Puerto Rico. That figured has already been topped, with a Florida emergency management official telling AFP that more than 134,000 Puerto Ricans have arrived in Florida since October 3 through the international airports of Tampa, Orlando and Miami. But it’s unclear how many are moving to Florida permanently compared to how many are simply visiting temporarily. The move is one of the biggest obstacles to recovery for the island, which has been beset by financial hardship. “The population decrease in Puerto Rico… has multiple economic repercussions for the island,” Jorge Duany, an anthropologist at Florida International University who specializes in Puerto Rican migration, said in an interview. As of Monday, only 42 percent of Puerto Rican customers had electricity on the island, which went dark after Maria. At least 51 people died because of the storm, according to official figures, while the local press speaks of dozens of people who have disappeared. Some 2,600 people still live in shelters.

[unused1] [unused2] 20 killed in Kabul suicide attack Kabul: A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital killed at least 20 on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing, officials said. The Islamic State, which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years, issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.

Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the US embassy and other foreign missions. As security forces arrived, a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene. Police officers said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers, but there was no official confirmation. "Kabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest," Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said. While Afghan forces backed by US air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the US announced a stepped up military strategy last year, high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.

[unused1] [unused2] Cold wave in Mysuru: Chimps get woollen blankets, big cats heaters. With a cold wave gripping the city, heaters are keeping the large- and medium-sized carnivores warm at Mysuru zoo. The drop in night temperatures has forced zoo keepers to boost the heat in the holding rooms of tigers, lions and leopards. Based on the night temperature, the room temperature of the animal holding rooms is artificially increased using heaters. Chimpanzees have been given warm material such as woollen blankets to keep warm at night. Gunny bags too have been placed inside their rooms for the smart primates to crawl inside and sleep snugly. Besides adjusting the temperature, the zoo authorities have also changed the the dietary plans of some animals to help them adjust to the fluctuating temperatures. C. Ravishankar, the zoo’s executive director, told The Hindu that the zoo veterinarians were keeping an eye on the animals. All large carnivores such as tigers, lions and leopards are not being kept in the day crawl at night and are being let inside their holding rooms. But in the case of medium-sized carnivores such as wild dogs, hyenas and wolves, the animal gets to choose between staying outdoors in the open enclosure or going inside the holding room where heaters regulate the temperature. “We have kept woollen blankets inside the holding rooms of chimps. They sleep on the clothing to keep themselves warm. And the heaters are placed outside the animal holding rooms and are switched on for a specific period of time under the supervision of the keepers,” Mr. Ravishankar said. However, over the past couple of days, the day temperatures have risen here, forcing the authorities to manage both the day and night temperatures. Water jets, which are usually operated in the summer, are being used now to keep animals such as elephants and Indian gaur cool. Water is sprayed even on deers and sambars. If the day temperature is high, water jets are opened at lion enclosures too, the director added.
[unused1] [unused2] Naval officer rams into parked truck on Mumbai-Pune Expressway, dies. NAVI MUMBAI: A 26-year-old navy lieutenant posted at INS Shivaji in Lonavla died of head injuries after his car rear-ended into a truck parked illegally in the third lane of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway early on Sunday. Police suspect the victim, Srikanth Obaya Nagipogu, who was returning to Lonavla after a meeting in Mumbai, might have not seen the truck as it was dark and crashed into it JUST ahead of Bhatan tunnel near Kon village. Panvel taluka police arrested the truck driver, Dilawar Hamid Patel (42), who hails from Karad, and booked him under the Indian Penal Code for causing death by negligence and rash driving among other charges. Motorists are prohibited from halting their vehicle on the Expressway. "Patel claimed that he pulled into the extreme left lane on the Pune carriageway as he suspected his truck had developed some mechanical fault," said police sub-inspector Nilesh Taru. "Patel claimed he was under the truck checking for any faults, when the car crashed into his vehicle from behind around 3.30am. He said as he could not remove the driver from the car, which was badly mangled, he waited for police to arrive." The highway safety patrol police reached the spot minutes after receiving the information from the control room. "We suspect the truck driver had parked his vehicle to take a nap. But as there are no other witnesses, we cannot confirm it," said Tare. "If he was feeling sleepy, he should have parked his vehicle in the service lane, and not the third lane." After post-mortem, police handed over Nagipogu's body to his brother in the presence of naval officers. "The brother has taken the body to their home town in Andhra Pradesh's Kadapa district for the final rites," said police sub-inspector Neelam Pawar.

[unused1] [unused2] Death toll rises to 38 in Mogadishu bombings MOGADISHU: Two car bombings killed 38 people in the Somali capital Mogadishu on Friday, the city's main ambulance service told AFP on Saturday. "We have seen at least 38 people dead," said Abdukadir Abdurahman Aden of the Aamin Ambulance of the bombings that targeted the presidential palace and a hotel. The first blast, followed by gunfire, occurred at a security checkpoint close to Villa Somalia, the name for the seat of government, while a second followed soon after at a hotel, according to police. The Shabaab Islamist militant group claimed the attacks in a statement posted online, saying it was targeting the government and security services. The blasts follow weeks of relative calm in Mogadishu. According to officials, the main attack involved the use of a vehicle loaded with explosives attempting to breach a checkpoint leading to the presidential palace, but security forces prevented the assault. "The security forces foiled the intent of the terrorists. They were aiming for key targets but they could not even go closer, there were five of them killed by the security force," said Abdulahi Ahmed, a security officer. The Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalia's internationally-backed government. In October it carried out its deadliest-ever bombing, killing over 500 people. In the wake of that attack Somalia's government declared a fresh offensive against the group and US drone strikes have increased in frequency. While the militant group was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force it continues to control large parts of the countryside and launches regular attacks on government, military and civilian targets.

[unused1] [unused2] Strong quake hits northeast Japan, no tsunami risk. A strong earthquake struck northeast of Tokyo on Wednesday but there was no fear of a tsunami, Japan’s meteorological agency said. It put the magnitude at 6.3, while the US Geological Survey measured it at 5.9. The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, 18 km north-northeast of the town of Daigo. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters, adding that no abnormalities were detected at nuclear power plants in the region. Japan sits at the junction of four tectonic plates and experiences a number of relatively violent quakes every year. But rigid building codes and strict enforcement mean even strong tremors often do little damage. A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into Japan’s northeast coast, leaving more than 18,000 people dead or missing, and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. In April two strong earthquakes hit southern Japan’s Kumamoto prefecture followed by more than 1,700 aftershocks, leaving at least 50 dead and causing widespread damage.

[unused1] [unused2] UK braced for Storm Emma as heavy snow causes chaos. content:London, February 28 . A brutal winter blast, named ‘Beast from the East’ after the direction of the winds, is set to transform into Storm Emma as the UK suffers severe travel disruptions and chaos due to heavy snow. The Meteorological Office issued a rare red warning, which indicates danger to life, in Scotland after a second day of heavy snow today. Several trains and flights have faced cancellations and delays since the start of this week, as airports around the country suspend operations to clear the snow from runways. “We are expecting quite wide impacts from (Storm) Emma when she arrives tomorrow night. We are forecasting more snow, strong winds and freezing rain which will make driving conditions extremely dangerous,” a Met Office spokesperson said. Amber warnings, calling for people to be wary, are in place in northern and eastern England, and the East Midlands, with a number of police forces warning against driving because of poor visibility and treacherous conditions, leading to crashes and stranded motorists. Four people are believed to have died in road crashes directly linked to the severe weather conditions across Britain. “The Beast from the East will tighten its grip as the week goes on. Gale-force winds and super-cooled freezing rain could turn parts of the UK into an ice rink by the weekend,” said Sara Thornton, director of digital weather service Weathertrending. “So far the north and east of the country have borne the brunt of the snow, but now the arrival of Storm Emma will bring the white stuff to millions more of us on Friday. Gales will come with the snow, bringing blizzard conditions to some southern and western parts of the UK that have so far been spared the snow,” she said. The snow has forced the closure of hundreds of schools across the UK, after overnight temperatures dropped to almost -12 degrees Celsius in some areas. There are fears that some rural communities could be cut off as power cuts and mobile phone network interruptions are expected. The army has been drafted into Lincolnshire to help emergency services, who have stepped up their official response to “critical”. There are fears that one of this winter’s longest big freezes in the UK could result in the highest death toll for 20 years. — PTI

[unused1] [unused2] Blaze brings down Ludhiana building Nidhi Bhardwaj | TNN | Updated: Jun 22, 2019, 10:33 IST The two-storied building in Ludhiana’s Focal Point before it collapsed on Friday morning LUDHIANA: A major fire ripped through a two-storey building and brought it down in Phase V of Focal Point early on Friday. Two firemen and a few onlookers received minor injuries in the ensuing rumpus as the conflagration set off balls of fire. The incident reminiscent of 2017 Amarson Polymers building collapse had firemen on the alert. The blaze started from the second floor of the building — which housed two hosiery units, one of garments and a godown — around 9pm Thursday. Within minutes, it spread to the first floor. Onlookers called up the fire department that rushed 16 tenders to the spot. At the time, there were no employees in the building that had closed after the day’s work. Initially, firemen tried to douse the flames from outside as the shutters of the units were locked. But with their efforts bearing little results, they broke open the locks to gain access to the building. While one group of firemen went to the first floor, the other carried out the operation on the second floor. As the flames sprawled towards the ground floor, the firemen rushed out. Minutes later, between 2.30am and 3am, the building collapsed following a blast. Even as seven firemen, including two sub-fire officers, had a narrow escape, two of them — Gurinder Singh and Sandeep Singh — suffered minor injuries after the ravaging fire let loose balls of fire. The flying sparks left a few onlookers injured, too, as they jostled against the other at the crowded site. The injured were administered first-aid at the spot as an ambulance reached there. As firemen resumed the operation, earth-moving machines were brought to the site to clear the debris. Raj Kumar, an eye-witness and friend of the building owner, said, “The blaze started from the second floor. A neighbour informed me about the incident and called up the fire department. Through plastic pipes that drain water, the flames reached the ground floor. The building owner, Amit Arora, and his family are abroad. When my son was trying to bring out important documents from the office, a blast rocked the building. Though he ran out in the nick of time, he has received a few injuries.” Assistant divisional fire officer Bhupinder Sandhu said, “A major tragedy was averted... had the firemen not rushed out in time, the collapse could have proved fatal for them. The building lacked fire-safety arrangements. For water, we had to depend on a neighbouring factory, an overhead tank in Sherpur and Focal Point fire station.” A fireman said, “As the building owner was not here, nobody took out the material kept on the ground floor despite repeated reminders. If the material stored inside the building was taken out, then the blast might not have taken place as fire reached the ground floor after almost five hours.” By evening, the situation was brought under control. But three tenders were on the stand-by at the site.

The accident caught on CCTV or closed-circuit television camera showed Puneet Parashar, 35, and his brother Vivek Parashar, 30, being flung into the air after a white car hit them at a traffic signal on the Birla Temple crossing. The brothers, who were going home at around 4.30pm on Tuesday, were thrown 60 feet away and when the signal turned green people drove away without stopping to help the men lying on road. They were killed on the spot, police said. Ten others, including a woman who was selling toys on the road, were injured. Six of them are in critical condition, police said. According to police, the car driver said he had borrowed his employer’s car to take his parents to SMS Hospital for an MRI investigation.

[unused1] [unused2] 22-year-old biker killed on Meenatai Thackeray flyover in Thane A 22-year-old labourer died on Monday after his bike skidded and his head hit a pole on the Meenatai Thackeray flyover in Thane. The man’s 47-year-old friend, who was riding pillion, suffered minor injuries. The incident comes a day after the flyover was inaugurated by Yuva Sena president Aaditya Thackeray on Sunday.

[unused1] [unused2] Kolkata youth with iron rod stuck in skull discharged after successful surgery kolkata Updated: May 29, 2018 22:04 IST A 3.5-feet-long iron rod was successfully removed by doctors in Kolkata from the skull of a youth, who suffered severe brain damage after the metal pierced through his forehead and the cranium in a car accident. The patient discharged on Tuesday. Tarique (24) was released from the Apollo Gleneagles hospital during the day, a month after the critical brain surgery, said to be unprecedented in eastern India. “Tarique suffered a car accident on April 28 in which a 3.5 ft long iron rod of the roadside divider broke and went through his forehead leaving him profusely bleeding and with very little life expectancy when he was brought to the hospital,” said Binod Kumar Singhania, consultant neuro surgeon at the hospital. The doctor revealed they had to get on with the surgery without much prior knowledge about the extent of the patient’s brain damage as it was difficult to conduct a CT scan with such a big piece of metal stuck in his head. They eventually removed the rod through a unique endoscopic process with proper haemostasis — a process which causes bleeding to stop. “The case was extremely tricky as the biggest challenge was to minimise the bleeding inside the skull after removing the metal rod. As the brain remains enclosed inside the skull, too much bleeding could have damaged a large number of brain cells that may have led to the patient’s death,” the doctor said. Singhania admitted that he hasn’t performed such an operation in his 30-year-long career as a neurosurgeon. “The operation was successful and it was found that the patient did not suffer any major vessel damage in the accident. He is currently stable. However, there is a problem with his speech and movements of the right side limbs, which would need post-operative care like physiotherapy and speech therapy,” he said. Another doctor in the hospital lauded the success of the operation as a “miracle” and stressed that such accident victims should be immediately transferred to a specialised medical care without any attempt to remove the rod. “It is a miraculous success as most patients with such injuries can’t be saved. It is important that he was immediately brought to the hospital and no attempts were made to remove the rod from his skull. Otherwise, the situation would have been fatal as the patient would have profusely bled from the wound,” said Suresh Ramasubban, senior consultant of pulmonary critical care department in the hospital.
[unused1] [unused2] 19 kids among 94 dead as Iraq ferry on holiday trip sinks in Tigris River Over 90 people, mostly women and children, died as a ferry packed with families celebrating Kurdish New Year sank in a swollen river in the former jihadist stronghold of Mosul, in Iraq’s worst accident in years. There was an outpouring of grief among residents who only this year resumed the annual festivities on the banks of the Tigris after the northern city’s recapture from the Islamic State group. Prime minister Adel Abdel Mahdi decreed three days of national mourning as he visited the site of the tragedy. He ordered a swift investigation “to determine responsibilities”. The vessel was crammed with men, women and children crossing the Tigris Thursday to go to a popular picnic area to celebrate Nowruz, the Kurdish New Year and a holiday across Iraq marking the start of spring. The accident, which struck as the overloaded vessel turned back, also coincided with Mother’s Day in Iraq. The interior ministry, issuing a fresh toll, said 94 people had died and 55 were rescued, after its spokesman Saad Maan said at least 19 children were among the dead. The premier said 61 women had died in the accident. While war and jihadist attacks have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in Iraq in recent years, such accidents are relatively rare. “It’s a disaster, no one expected that,” said a young man who had just managed to reach the shore. “There were a lot of people on the boat, especially women and children,” he told AFP. A Mosul security source said the high water levels and overcrowding on the boat, with well over 100 people on board, had been to blame for the disaster. “The boat sank because there were too many passengers on board,” another security official based in Mosul told AFP. Iraq’s justice ministry said it had ordered the arrest of nine ferry company officials and banned the owners of the vessel and the tourist site from leaving the country. The authorities had warned people to be cautious after several days of heavy rains led to water being released through the Mosul dam, causing the river level to rise. Videos shared on social media showed a fast-flowing, bloated river and dozens of people floating in the water or trying to swim around the partly submerged boat. Search operations stretched far downstream from the site where the boat sank, according to an AFP journalist. Hundreds of people who had flocked to the forested area for the first days of spring gathered on the river banks as the disaster unfolded. Ambulances and police vehicles transported the dead and wounded to hospitals in the city of nearly two million people. Photos of victims, many of them women and children, were posted on the walls of a morgue for families unable to enter because of the large crowd who had gathered to identify their relatives. One man, scanning over the pictures, stopped abruptly at the image of a woman. In shock, he gasped: “It’s my wife”, before collapsing in tears. IS turned Mosul into their de facto Iraqi capital after the jihadists swept across much of the country’s north in 2014. The city spent three years under the group’s iron-fisted rule until it was recaptured by Iraqi troops backed by a US-led coalition in 2017.
[unused1] [unused2] 19 killed, Beira city shut off as tropical cyclone slams Mozambique Tropical cyclone Idai battered central Mozambique on March 15 killing at least 19 people and cutting off more than half a million people in one of the country's largest cities Beira. State broadcaster Radio Mocambique, said "preliminary information points to 19 deaths and more than 70 injured in Sofala province as a result of cyclone Idai". Most of the deaths occurred in Beira — a port hub and capital of Sofala province — a city which has virtually been cut off after power lines crashed, the airport was shut and roads swamped by flooding. The flooding had already killed 66 people nationwide in days preceding the cyclone. "The hardest moment was overnight and this morning," provincial governor Alberto Mondlane told state radio referring to the time the cyclone barrelled through the province. "There has been a lot of damage. Many homes have been left without roofs." An official at the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) told AFP earlier that "houses and trees were destroyed and pylons downed." Airport shut Authorities were forced to close Beira international airport after the air traffic control tower, the navigation systems and the runways were damaged by the storm. "Unfortunately there is extreme havoc," said the official. "Some runway lights were damaged, the navigation system is damaged, the control tower antennas and the control tower itself are all damaged. The runway is full of obstacles and parked aircrafts are damaged." Late on Wednesday, the national carrier LAM cancelled all flights to Beira and Quelimane, which is also on the coast, as well as to Chomoio, which is inland. Power utility Electricidade de Mocambique said in a statement that the provinces of Manica, Sofala and parts of Inhambane have been without power since March 14. Devastation Another official, Pedro Armando Alberto Virgula, in Chinde north of Beira, said a hospital, police station and seven schools there lost their roofs and several houses were destroyed. Bonifacio Cebola, a spokesman for the Beira Central Hospital, said that the theatre at the country's second largest hospital was not spared and surgeries have been suspended. "Because of the cyclone, the (theatre) no longer has conditions for patients to be operated on," Cebola said to Radio Moçambique. Local officials said that this week's heavy rains had already claimed 66 lives, injured 111 people and displaced 17,000 people. The World Food Programme (WFP) said it would move 20 tonnes of emergency food aid to the affected areas. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had warned that the storm could pack winds of up to 190 kilometres per hour (118 miles per hour). Natural disaster At least 126 people were killed by the downpour that has struck parts of Mozambique, Malawi and South Africa over the past week, officials said. Heavy rains in neighbouring Malawi have affected almost a million people and claimed 56 lives, according to the latest government toll. Authorities there have opened emergency relief camps where malaria and shortages of supplies have led to dire conditions, according to AFP correspondents. Malawian President Peter Mutharika this week declared a natural disaster. Mozambique's weather service has warned that heavy rain will continue to batter Beira and surrounding areas until March 17. The UN warned of damage to crops, "including about 168,000 hectares (415,000 acres) of crops already impacted by flooding in early March, which will undermine food security and nutrition". and two of the poorest countries in the world, are prone to deadly flooding during the rainy season and chronic drought during the dry season. In neighbouring Zimbabwe, weather services have warned that violent thunderstorms, lightning and strong winds will be experienced in the eastern regions of the country.
[unused1] [unused2] Four suspended in connection with Uttarakhand road accident that killed 9 school children Updated: Aug 07, 2019 19:34 IST Four persons including a transport officer, an education officer and two police department personnel were suspended and Tehri’s basic education officer was summoned on the direction of Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in connection with Tuesday’s road accident which killed nine school children in Uttarakhand. The action was taken after preliminary investigations revealed overloading led to the accident at Kangsali near Lambgaon in Tehri district, an official release here said. Sub-inspector Mayank Tyagi, constable Durgesh Kothiyal were suspended for not keeping an effective tab on overloading vehicles. Transport tax officer of the area Nikhilesh Ojha has also been suspended for dereliction of duty. After it surfaced that the school where the accident victims studied was being run without official recognition, Jakhnidhar’s sub section education officer Dhanvir Singh was also suspended. Tehri’s basic education officer has also been summoned by the state government. The accident occurred early on Tuesday when the van taking the students fell into a 200 metre deep gorge killing nine children aged between 4-13 and leaving 11 others injured. The driver jumped off the vehicle to save himself and fled the spot. Overloading appeared to have been one of the factors that led to the accident as the van could accommodate only 10 people, but was carrying 21, including the driver, an official had said on Tuesday.
[unused1] [unused2] Dozens feared dead in Nigeria as leaking oil tanker explodes An overturned oil tanker exploded in Nigeria while dozens of people were scooping up the leaking fuel and many were killed, police and witnesses said on January 12. “We have recovered 12 corpses and taken 22 persons with serious burns to hospital,” police spokeswoman Irene Ugbo told . She said the blast occurred on January 11 evening in Odukpani in Cross River State in the southeast. But some residents put the death toll closer to 60. “The police only recovered a few corpses, many of the other dead were burnt to ashes,” witness Richard Johnson told the AP. It was not immediately clear what caused the truck to overturn. About a year ago, more than 30 residents in the same locality were burnt to death while scooping fuel from an oil tanker involved in an accident. Nigeria’s worst such accident occurred in 1998, when more than 1,000 people died as the leaking oil pipeline from which they were scooping fuel exploded in the town of Jesse.
[unused1] [unused2] 3 killed, 10 injured in accident on NH-24 Updated: Jun 30, 2019 14:48 IST Three persons, two of them from a family, were killed and 10 others injured after the minibus they were travelling in rammed a water tanker from behind on NH-24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) near East Vinod Nagar late Saturday. Police said the group was headed to Uttarakhand’s Nainital on a vacation and the minibus, Tempo Traveller, was allegedly speeding. The tanker driver fled the spot immediately after the accident but was arrested on Saturday afternoon and booked for rash driving and causing death by negligence, the police said. The three dead persons were identified as Mukesh Jain (39), his nephew Monu Jain (13), and driver Nishan Singh (34). The injured persons are family members of Mukesh. His wife Poonam Jain (36) is critical and undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Patparganj. The other injured persons were admitted to three different hospital in east Delhi and Kaushambi, Ghaziabad. They were identified as Poonam’s children — Lovesh (14) and Khushbu (22) — her mother Premwati Jain (63), brother Sudarshan Jain (44), his wife Kumud Jain (38), and their children – Daya (15) and Arpit (10) — Sudarshan’s niece Priyanka, 21 and cousin Anurag. The accident, which took place around midnight, caused a heavy jam on the carriageway towards Ghaziabad. Hundreds of motorists were stuck in a 2km long snarl, which continued till 2am. Police said the Tempo driver Nishan lived in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar. He was employed by a private transport company and the minibus belonged to the company. The Jains hired it to go on a three-day vacation to Nainital. Around 10.30pm, Nishan picked up 12 members of the Jain family from their Uttam Nagar home and left for Nainital. The Tempo had reached the East Vinod Nagar underpass when the mishap took place. The impact of the crash was such that the front right portion of the vehicle was mangled. Nishan and at least four passengers were trapped inside. The fire department’s rescue team had to cut open the vehicle to extract the trapped occupants, the police said. “Eyewitnesses told police the rear door of the Tempo was thrown open in the crash and some occupants fell out. But no injured person was found lying behind the vehicle when police arrived. Some of the injured persons had already been moved to a nearby hospital. Mukesh Jain, Monu, and the Tempo driver Nishan were declared brought dead,” a police officer said. DCP (east) Jasmeet Singh said the tanker driver told police the truck was moving slowly because of a faulty clutch and the minibus crashed into it. The family members, however, denied the claim. “The cause of the accident will be ascertained after due investigation,” Singh said.

[unused1] [unused2] IAF strike on JeM’s Balakot terror camp involved over 200 hours of planning balakot terror camp,IAF,air strike on JeM camp The Indian Air Force carried out a pre-dawn air strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) biggest terror camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Tuesday, Feb 26, 2019.(ANI) The pre-dawn attack air strike by Indian Air Force (IAF) on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) biggest terror camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on early Tuesday involved over 200 hours of planning that began following intelligence inputs regarding a second suicide terror strike somewhere in India. Highly-placed sources said that the government got the intelligence input just two days after the February 14 terror strike in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama by JeM suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed and five suffered injuries. The intelligence input warned of another suicide terror attack - which could be bigger than Pulwama - at any place across India, said the source. Soon after the input, a series of meetings were held among top government officials and ministers concerned, the chiefs of the Army, Navy and IAF and National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval to give befitting reply to the JeM terrorists. The final decision to carry out an air strike on a Pakistan-based terror camp was taken in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with home minister Rajnath Singh, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Doval and IAF chief, Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, present. “The meeting finalised an air strike on the terror camps as the only option to take revenge for security personnel killed in Pulwama attack and give a big jolt to the JeM’s plan to carry out another strike in India. Over 200 hours of planning went into the air strike in which every aspect was taken care of,” said the source. It was decided that the revenge would be taken on the 13th day of Pulwama attack to pay “best homage” to the slain CRPF personnel who lost their lives after a bus, part of a 78-vehicle convoy, they were travelling in was blown up by Adil’s car packed with over 200 kg of explosives on the Jammu-Srinagar highway, said the source. Another source said that 16 Sukhoi fighter jets were backing over 12 Mirage 2000 fighter jets that pounded multiple terror camps across the Line of Control (LoC) in what is being seen as the first cross-border air strike India has carried out in nearly five decades. “Mirage jets left their base in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and after mid-air fuelling over Adampur in Punjab, they struck the terror camps in Balakot.” When India decided to raise the bar after the Pulwama attack, Balakot was on the radar of Indian intelligence agencies for being a hub of JeM. Intelligence agencies were sure that the Pulwama attack was also planned in Balakot terror camp which was headed by JeM chief Masood Azhar’s brother-in-law Maulana Yusuf Azhar. The location of Balakot, well away from the LoC, made it a safe heaven for terrorist training. Even the Border Action Teams (BATs) of Pakistan army regulars, who carry out cross-border raids on Indian patrols on the LoC, are trained in Balakot. Foreign Secretary Vijay K. Gokhale on Tuesday told the media that a very large number of JeM terrorists, including senior commanders, trainers and groups of jihadis who were being trained for fidayeen (suicide attack) missions, were eliminated in the operation. “India struck the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot. Credible intelligence was received that the JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country (India), and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose,” Gokhale said. Pakistan admitted that the IAF planes struck Balakot but claimed that they returned when it scrambled its war planes.

[unused1] [unused2] 20 Dead As Bus Parked Next To Illegal Fuel Shop Catches Fire In Peru World | Reuters | Updated: April 01, 2019 17:19 IST Lima: At least 20 people were killed and eight injured when the double-decker bus they were traveling in caught on fire in the Peruvian capital Lima on Sunday, a spokesman for the country's firefighters said. Witnesses said the fire started in the bus's motor at the rear of the vehicle and quickly spread to its interior, according to the spokesman Lewis Mejia, in broadcast comments on local TV channel Canal N. The cause of the fire is under investigation, he added. Lima's Mayor Jorge Munoz said the bus burst into flames at a bustop that authorities had banned just weeks ago because it was located next to an illegal shop that sells fuel. "It appears that on the second floor of bus, where most of the victims were found, they were transporting fuel. That's a very serious matter," Munoz told journalists in broadcast comments before visiting survivors at a local hospital. Eight units of firefighters were deployed to put out the fire on the bus, which had been headed to the northern coastal city of Chiclayo, according to local broadcaster RIP. TV images showed the scorched remains of the vehicle surrounded by crowds of people in the district of San Martin de Porres on the outskirts of the capital. Authorities in Lima have repeatedly failed to reign in the city's so-called "informal" transportation system, a chaotic network of independent and unauthorized vans and buses used by millions of people every day. Firefighters found that the bus lacked fire extinguishers and safety equipment, RPP reported Munoz vowed to punish the owners. COMMENT "They have defied a municipal order...I'm completely outraged," Munoz said. "These people must be removed and criminal sanctions will be sought.

[unused1] [unused2] Safety gear failed in Mirage crash that killed both pilots The deaths of two Indian Air Force (IAF) test pilots in a Mirage 2000 crash at the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) airport in Bengaluru last week may have been caused in part by arrester barriers, critical airfield safety equipment, giving way, officials with first-hand information of the matter said on condition of anonymity. The reason for the crash itself remain unknown — the black box of the fighter has been sent to France for analysis — but the death of the pilots could have been averted if the barriers, meant to stop the aircraft, had held, one of the officials added. “Once the arresters gave way, there was little chance that the two had of bringing the aircraft to rest,” he said. The two pilots, Squadron Leader Samir Abrol and Squadron Leader Siddhartha Negi, died on the spot. The arresters installed at HAL airport are expected to stop aircraft that weigh up to 30 tonnes travelling at speeds of up to 160-170 knots. The Mirage 2000 trainer weighs much less, 13-14 tonnes, and was travelling at a speed of less than 160 knots, the officials added. Abrol and Negi were on an “acceptance sortie” of the Mirage 2000 trainer aircraft after it was overhauled by the Bengaluru-based, state-owned company. The sortie was taking place on the HAL runway in Yemalur in Bengaluru on February 1. An HAL spokesperson declined comment. An Indian Air Force (IAF) spokesperson, too, declined comment because of the ongoing court of inquiry into the accident. The accident occurred a day after IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa criticised HAL, and also pointed to the number of pilots who lost their lives testing the state-owned firm’s indigenously developed aircraft. According to the officials, the number of times major snags have been detected by IAF at the time of delivery in an aircraft overhauled or manufactured by HAL is high. For instance, last June, an Su-30 was on an acceptance sortie (its 13th) when it crashed near Nashik. The pilot and the flight engineer ejected successfully. These sorties are done by IAF only after HAL has flown the aircraft a certain number of times and cleared them for acceptance. In 2018-2019, the Russian designed Su-30Mki – the mainstay fighter of the IAF – manufactured by HAL required as many as six sorties as against the designated two sorties before they could be accepted. “The increased number of sorties is because snags were found,” a second senior government official said. Similarly, Mirage 2000 aircraft overhauled by HAL have, on average, required two sorties more than the mandatory number because of snags. And, Jaguars, the British made deep-strike bombers that are overhauled by HAL, have required, on average, three sorties more than the two sorties designated for acceptance. For the advanced light helicopters (ALH), flown by the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force, and also made by HAL, the numbers are equally bad. “Every aircraft needs to go through a certain number of sorties testing various test points before it can be accepted by IAF for deployment. The fact that the more sorties are having to be flown to rectify the snags indicates either the process of testing is not being done properly by the manufacturer or the process lacks rigorousness at the HAL end,” said Air Marshal SBP Sinha (retd), who till recently was the Air Officer Commanding at the Central Air Command of IAF. Arrester barriers are installed at the end of the runway to deal with exactly the kind of situation the overhauled Mirage 2000 trainer was facing. They are meant to stop an aircraft that has either aborted take-off or made an emergency landing from overshooting the runway with minimal damage to aircraft or injury to the crew. In this case, the Mirage 2000 trainer came down seconds after take-off. The undercarriage of the aircraft was sheared off, most likely because of the impact. And the arrester barrier was the only way that the two test pilots could have brought the aircraft to a stop. The black box of the fighter has been sent to France for a detailed analysis to assist the Court of Inquiry (CoI) that is investigating the crash. “Separately, inquiries are also being conducted on why the arrester barrier gave way,” said a senior HAL official who asked not to be named.

[unused1] [unused2] In Jammu and Kashmir 35 killed as overcrowded bus skids off road, falls into gorge Updated: Jul 01, 2019 22:55 IS At least 35 people were killed and 17 others injured when an overloaded minibus skidded off a winding road and fell into a deep gorge in Jammu and Kashmir’s mountainous Kishtwar district on Monday. This is the second major accident in the state since Thursday when 11 students were killed when their bus fell into a ravine while they were on their way for a picnic in Shopian district. Kishtwar’s deputy commissioner, Angrez Singh Rana, said 10 of the 17 injured were airlifted in a helicopter to Jammu, around 230 km away, for treatment in view of their critical condition. He said the exact cause of the accident remained a subject of investigation. “But the minibus was overloaded. The driver’s negligence cannot be ruled out,” he said. Rana said that the 28-seater bus was carrying 52 passengers. Kishtwar’s senior police superintendent, Shakti Pathak, said the condition of the road was bad and the minibus was apparently overloaded. “It seems the driver lost control near a curve and the vehicle rolled down into a gorge,’’ he said. Pathak added 20 passengers died on the spot and 15 more succumbed to their injuries at the Kishtwar district hospital. The accident prompted Jammu and Kashmir governor, Satya Pal Malik, to order the cancellation of licences of untrained drivers. It was not immediately clear how such drivers would be identified. Malik, who has helmed the state since June 2018 in the absence of an elected government, said many of the drivers plying buses in the state are untrained. “Most of the accidents take place due to careless and untrained drivers, who drive without any regard for rules,” Malik said in a statement. He announced a compensation of ~5 lakh each for the families of the deceased. He promised a thorough probe into such accidents. He added “strong decisions” would be taken to ensure strict action against those responsible for such avoidable accidents. A spokesperson for Malik said the governor had a few months ago directed the transport department to take unfit vehicles and untrained drivers off the roads. Officials blamed speeding for the June 27 accident in Shopian. Shopian deputy commissioner, Owais Ahmad, had said the accident happened near a curve, which is wide enough. He added the road condition is also good and that it appears the driver was over speeding as the vehicle went over a parapet. A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had said that prima facie investigations into the Shopian accident revealed that the vehicle had old worn out tyres and that it was given fitness certificate last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over the loss of lives in the Kishtwar accident. “The accident in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar is heart-wrenching. We mourn all those who lost their lives and express condolences to the bereaved families. May the injured recover at the earliest,” he tweeted. Former chief ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, too, expressed their grief.

The attack at the Al-Anad Air Base, where American special forces once led their fight against Yemen’s al-Qaeda branch, targetted high-ranking military officials in Yemen’s internationally recognised government. “Once again this proves that the Houthi criminal militias are not ready for peace and that they are exploiting truces in order for deployment and reinforcements,” said Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani, who said two senior military officials were wounded in the attack. This is time for the international community to stand by the legitimate government and force the militias to give up their weapons and pull out of the cities,” he added. The Houthis immediately claimed the attack through their al-Masirah satellite news channel, saying the attack targeted “invaders and mercenaries” at the base in the southern province of Lahj, leaving “dozens of dead and wounded.” Yemeni officials said that among the wounded were Mohammad Saleh Tamah, head of Yemen’s Intelligence Service, senior military commander Mohammad Jawas, and Lahj governor Ahmed al-Turki, adding that authorities were still searching for wounded among the rubble. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to reporters. Army spokesman Mohammed al-Naqib was delivering a speech from a podium when the drone exploded. “It was a very strong explosion and we could feel the pressure,” local reporter Nabil al-Qaiti, who witnessed the attack, said, adding that two of the people standing next to him a soldier and a journalist were wounded. “The drone was packed with explosives,” he added. Some 8,000 soldiers had been taking part in the parade, as well as two governors and a large number of top military commanders including the chief of staff.
[unused1] [unused2] Key conspirator' in Pulwama suicide car bomb attack among 2 militants killed in encounter Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) ‘commander’ Mudasir Ahmad Khan, a “key conspirator” in the Pulwama attack that left 40 CRPF jawans dead on February 14, was among two militants killed in an encounter at Tral in Pulwama on Sunday night. “We have managed to kill the main conspirator Mudasir Ahmed Khan, a resident of Tral’s Midoora village. Another JeM militant from Pakistan, known as Khalid, was also killed,” said Lieutenant-General K.J.S. Dhillon, General Officer Commanding of the Army’s 15 Corps. He was addressing a press conference with CRPF Inspector-General (Operations) Zulfiqar Hasan and Inspector General of Police S.P. Pani. Khan and his associate were trapped in a residential area in Pinglish village on Sunday afternoon. The house where they were holed up was blasted. The police retrieved the charred bodies of the militants on Monday morning. Khan’s body was handed over to the family. Khan alias Mohammad Bhai, 23, a graduate who worked as an electrician, joined the JeM in January 2018 after his handler and JeM ‘operational commander’ Noor Mohammed Tantray alias Noor Trali was killed in December 2017. The duo were involved in “planning and executing several terror attacks”, including a fidayeen (suicide) attack on a CRPF camp at Lethpora in Pulwama in December 2011, the police said. Security agencies believe Adil Ahmad Dar, the suicide bomber who blew up an explosive-laden car next to a CRPF convoy on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway on February 14, “was in touch with Khan” -- both belonged to Pulwama district. However, Sajjad Bhat from Anantnag’s Bijbehara area, who purchased the vehicle for the attack and joined the JeM, still remains on the run. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had also searched the house of Khan on February 27 and “seized many papers”. Earlier, three JeM militants, Hilal Ahmad, a local, and Kamran alias Fahad and Rashid alias Gazi alias Lukaman, both from Pakistan, were killed “within 100 hours of the attack on February 19”. The Army had said they were involved in the Pulwama attack too. Major successes against JeM: Army Meanwhile, The Army said it has achieved major successes against the JeM since the February 14 deadly attack. “Fourteen of 18 militants killed since the Pulwama attack were affiliated to JeM. Of the 18, 10 were locals and eight from Pakistan,” said Lt. Gen. Dhillon. IGP Pani said the recruitment of youth has come down significantly. “We haven’t seen such a thing (recruitment) in the last three months,” he said IGP Pani.
[unused1] [unused2] Bandipur fire: Accidental or an act of sabotage? Was the Bandipur fire accidental or an act of sabotage? That is the question being raised in conservation circles and among officials, given the frequency with which fires have been spotted simultaneously in different ranges. Though Bandipur has a history of forest fires as the dry deciduous forest tends to be bone dry during summer, they are usually confined to a specific range or division. But this year, a fire was first spotted at Kundugere and then at Melkahamanahalli, from where it spread to Gopalaswamy Betta. While there are no clues, the proliferation of lantana is reckoned to be one of the factors that led to intensive fire. This year, the Forest Department was apprehensive that the voluminous mass of lantana which covers almost 60% of the forest could provide additional fuel in case of a fire, and their fears have come true. Also, heavy rains during monsoon and unseasonal ones during November helped in the luxurious growth of vegetation, all of which dry up during summer, providing ample fuel for the fire to rage. The authorities had anticipated such a scenario and deployed nearly 400 watchers. But it is reckoned to be inadequate for the national park, which is spread over 912 sq.km. Sanjay Gubbi, a conservation biologist, said controlling fires needs a multi-pronged approach and prevention is the best solution. “An effective communication network, especially wireless systems, is of immense importance for early detection and control of forest fires. Similarly, employing staff as fire control watchers from villages and hamlets in and around the forests is crucial,” he added. Mr. Gubbi said discussions with community leaders and meetings to enlist their support before the fire season is key as it can dissuade miscreants from the local community from any misadventure. Campaigning with civil society can help rope in local support to prevent or contain forest fires.
[unused1] [unused2] 21 killed in fiery Mexico road accident: Officials Updated: May 30, 2019 11:56 IST A semi-truck and a bus carrying passengers back from a pilgrimage to a Catholic shrine crashed and burst into flames Wednesday in eastern Mexico, killing at least 21 people, officials said. Thirty others were injured. Most of the victims were pilgrims from the southern state of Chiapas who were on their way back from a trip to Mexico City to pray at the basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the country’s patron saint, said the head of the Civil Protection service for the state of Veracruz, Guadalupe Osorno. “The forensics experts at the scene report 17 bodies of passengers who were traveling in the bus, plus two people who died in the semi-truck,” she said. “One person was dead on arrival at the hospital, and another who was in serious condition died.” The Catholic archdiocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez, in Chiapas, sent its condolences to the victims’ loved ones in a statement. “We deeply regret the deaths caused by this accident and share in their families’ overwhelming pain,” it said. The accident occurred on a highway in a region known as the Maltrata hills, where the roads wind between peaks that rise more than 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) above sea level. Emergency officials at the scene said one of the vehicles lost its brakes going downhill and crashed into the other, causing both to erupt in flames and leaving the bus a charred frame lying on its side. Rescue and forensic workers carried away the bodies after covering them. In 2006, more than 50 Evangelical Christians were killed in the same region when their bus plunged into a ravine. Authorities said that accident was also caused by faulty brakes.

The bridge, connecting villages of Wada and Malwada, was shut for vehicular traffic after the river was in spate on Saturday, but a major portion collapsed on Sunday. The woes of Badlapur residents worsened as authorities had to release water from Barvi dam even as high tide prevented floodwater from subsiding. Over 10,000 people from low-lying areas were shifted to wedding halls and schools. Jayraj Deshmukh, tehsildar of Ambernath division, said, "Water entered low-lying areas and around 900 residents in chawls were shifted to safer places and food arrangements have been made." In Bhiwandi too, over 5,000 people were affected and around 1,500 residents from Idgah slum area were shifted to safer places. Rain played havoc in Palghar district with the administration seeking help of the NDRF to rescue people stranded in various places in Vasai (E). In Wada, villages were put on red alert after Vaitarna, Tansa and Pinjal rivers started overflowing. Residents stranded in Kaman, Batane, Mori in Vasai (E) were rescued by an NDRF team. Residents of Arnala village in Virar were also rescued as water level began rising early Sunday. Over 8,500 residents from various stretches in Diva had a narrow escape Sunday after the creek water rushed inside the suburb forcing the administration to initiate evacuation.

The constable, who succumbed, was identified as Narendra Khateek (34), a native of Alwar in Rajasthan. The two constables who are injured are Vinod Kumar (36) and Babulal Yadav (38). All of them were posted in CRPF’s Special Duty Group (SDG) and were deployed at the Prime Minister Office and PM’s residence. Vinod Kumar, the constable driving the WagonR car said that the incidet took place when they were returning home to Pushp Vihar. “We had all gone shopping to Lajpat Nagar.The accident took place when we were near Archana crossing. Our traffic light was green. But, as our car was crossing the signal, a Mercedes convertible speeding from Siri Fort Road, appeared out of nowhere and crashed into ours. Before we could brace ourselves, our car had turned turtle. The Mercedes further went on to ram a divider and then crashed into a traffic signal before coming to a halt,” Kumar said. He said passersby and locals immediately rushed to help them and called the police. “Miraculously, Yadav and I did not sustain any serious injuries but Khateek was unconscious. We were all rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where Khateek succumbed to his injuries on Friday morning. The others were given first aid and discharged,” said Kumar, who had been working with Khateek and Yadav for the past six years.

His children have lost their father but the accused has been granted bail. This is injustice,” he said. DCP Kumar, however, said that the offence is bailable under law. “We are looking into the case from all the possible angles. We have seized both the vehicles,” he said.

[unused1] [unused2] Two Fire Officers Suspended For Surat Fire, Coaching Centres Ordered Shut All India | Indo-Asian News Service | Updated: May 26, 2019 04:45 IST Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation on Saturday suspended two fire officers for granting a no-objection certificate to the building, which was engulfed by a devastating fire that claimed 22 young lives, hours after the manager of the coaching class where the students who died were studying was arrested and charges have been lodged against two others for the incident. Municipal Commissioner M Thenarasan told reporters that Surat's Deputy Chief Fire Officer SK Acharya and Fire Officer Kirti Modh were suspended with immediate effect on charges of not taking action against the Takshashila Arcade where Friday's blaze occurred for violation of fire safety norms. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani stated: "We have constituted an investigation committee, Urban Secretary (Principal Secretary, Urban Development), Mukesh Puri has been asked to file a report based on which we will take action. The manager and builder have been arrested." Surat Assistant Commissioner of Police PL Chaudhari late Saturday evening said the death toll in the incident had risen to 22. He informed reporters that "two teenage girls died today, taking the toll to 22, including 18 girls and four boys." Earlier, an official had said the number was 23. Around 12 injured persons were still undergoing treatment at various hospitals. Most of the students who were killed in the fire were aged between 14 and 17. Some were expecting their Class 12 results on Saturday. Shaken by the fire, all of Gujarat's eight municipal corporations and scores of municipalities on Saturday ordered a shutdown of all coaching centres running in commercial complexes. Officials said the coaching centres had been ordered to put all fire safety norms in place, without which they would not be allowed to function. The authorities started investigating fire safety norms in coaching classes, private hospitals and other buildings in various towns and cities of the state. Many of these buildings, including a library in capital Gandhinagar, were sealed, along with 40 coaching centres in Bharuch and many others at several places. The police have arrested Bhargav Butani, who ran the art and drawing classes in Takshashila Arcade building in Surat's Sarthana area, Police Commissioner Satish Sharma said. Two others, including the builder of the commercial complex, Harsukh Vekaria, were also booked. A search was on for the builder. Sharma told reporters: "We have ordered an investigation into the fire incident by the ACP, Crime Branch. A case under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide has been lodged against the accused." Official sources revealed there were no proper fire safety norms being followed in the building. Two shops and around a dozen two-wheelers parked below were also gutted in another fire sparked off by the blaze because of the electric wires and poles nearby. The fire broke out late afternoon around 4 p.m. in the Smart Design Studio, which ran illegally on the covered terrace of the Takshashila building that effectively became a fourth storey. Officials said the fire started at the ground floor and reached the top floor. Some students of another class, rushed to the terrace to escape the fire and found themselves stuck there. The only way to the top floor was a three-foot wooden staircase, which had been reduced to ashes. According to witnesses, there must have been around 50 students in the Takshashila Arcade building when it caught fire. Graphic videos on social media showed more than 10 panic-stricken students from the third and fourth storey jumping off to escape the blaze and the billowing smoke. Tragically, hundreds of people watched and many shot videos and pictures while student after student fell off the building like ninepins. Half of the dozen students who jumped in panic were killed. Eyewitnesses alleged the fire brigade staff, which got delayed by half an hour, did not have any nets to hold the students jumping from the building and even their hydraulic staircase could not go beyond a little over the second floor of the building. 1 COMMENT The cause of the deadly inferno is not yet clear, though officials believe it was sparked off by a short circuit in a sweet shop in the building.

[unused1] [unused2] 35 injured in road accident in Aligarh Agra: At least 35 people were injured, two of them critically, after the mini bus they were travelling in turned turtle in Aligarh at around 3:45 am on Friday. The driver, who fled the spot after the accident, is absconding. "A case has been registered him and an investigation is underway to nab him at the earliest," said senior superintendent if police (SSP) Aligarh, Raesh Pandey. The mini bus was on its way to Putha village in Gangiri area of Aligarh from Delhi when the driver lost control of the vehicle after hitting a speed breaker.

[unused1] [unused2] 2-hour jam on Gurugram’s Badli road as tractor runs over farmer gurgaon Updated: Jul 17, 2019 03:54 IST A 30-year-old farmer was critically injured after a speeding tractor ran over him in Iqbalpur village on Monday morning in Farukhnagar, about 23 kilometres from the city. Soon after, a group of villagers gathered at the spot to protest and demanded that a speed breaker be built at the spot immediately to check the rising number of accidents caused by speeding on the stretch. They also demanded installation of street lights. So far this month, four accidents have been reported from Iqbalpur village. The protest resulted in a three-kilometre-long traffic jam on the road that connects Gurugram with Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway at Badli. It took two hours to clear the vehicular congestion, the police said. According to the police, the accident occurred when the victim, Manoj Kumar, was trying to cross the main road around 9.30am. “An empty, speeding tractor, coming from Gurugram side, ran over Kumar. The driver applied brakes but by then one of the tyres had rolled over Kumar’s abdomen, which cut open,” villager Ram Kumar said. The passersby informed the police and called an ambulance. Kumar was rushed to a private hospital where his condition was reported to be critical, the police said. The police said the driver was arrested from the spot and the vehicle was impounded. The police have said they will register a case once the victim’s statement is recorded. A team of 15 police personnel reached the spot to control the situation and requested villagers to call off the protest, but it took almost an hour to convince the agitated crowd. Meanwhile, vehicles were diverted to a carriageway on the other side of the road, which resulted in a two-hour-long snarl. Deputy commissioner of police (Manesar) Rajesh Kumar said, “We have installed barricades at the spot and have requested the authorities to construct a speed breaker at the earliest. Also, we have deployed three constables on the stretch to keep a check on speeding vehicles.” The Gurugram-Farukhnagar Road witnesses heavy traffic as it serves as a link to Jhajjar, Rohtak and Badli, among other neighbouring areas from where a large number of people come to Gurugram for work. Villagers said they have to risk their lives every day to get to the main Gurugram road by crossing the busy connecting road where the accident took place. “With no speed breaker on the road, it is a nightmare. We will intensify our agitation if our demands are not fulfilled soon,” another villager from Iqbalpur, Ramesh Kumar, said.
[unused1] [unused2] New Zealand mosque shooting: Main accused charged with murder The main suspect in mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques was charged with one count of murder a day after an attack that killed 49 people and wounded dozens, prompting the Prime Minister to vow reform of the country's gun laws. Brenton Harrison Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian citizen, appeared in a Christchurch District Court on Saturday and was remanded without a plea until his next scheduled appearance in the South Island city's High Court on April 5. Handcuffed and wearing a white prison suit, Tarrant did not speak. His court-appointed lawyer made no application for bail or name suppression. He was likely to face further charges, police said. The attack, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labelled as terrorism, was the worst ever peacetime mass killing in New Zealand and the country raised its security threat level to the highest. Tarrant has been identified as a suspected white supremacist, based on his social media activity. Footage of the attack on one of the mosques was broadcast live on Facebook, and a “manifesto” denouncing immigrants as “invaders” was also posted online via links to related social media accounts. The video footage showed a man driving to the mosque, entering it and shooting randomly at people inside. Worshippers, possibly dead or wounded, lay on the floor, the video showed. Reuters was unable to confirm the footage's authenticity and police urged people not to view or share it. Police said the alleged shooter was arrested in a car, which was carrying improvised explosive devices, 36 minutes after they were first called. It was still unclear whether any other shooters were involved in the attacks. Two other people were in custody and police said they were working to understand their involvement. Armed police were deployed at several locations in all cities, unusual in a country that has had low levels of gun violence. Gun laws to be changed PM Ardern said the main suspect was a licensed gun owner who used five weapons during his rampage, including two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns. Authorities were working to find out how he had obtained the weapons and a license, and how he was able to enter the country to carry out the attack, she said. “I can tell you one thing right now, our gun laws will change,” Ardern told reporters, saying a ban on semi-automatic weapons would be considered. None of those arrested had a criminal history or was on any watchlist in New Zealand or Australia. Sorrow, Sympathy There was a heavy police presence at the hospital where families of the more than 40 wounded had gathered. Eleven people remained in intensive care, hospital authorities said. Funerals were planned on Saturday for some of the victims, several of whom were born overseas. Dozens of people laid flowers at cordons near both mosques in Christchurch, which is still rebuilding after a devastating earthquake in 2011 that killed almost 200 people. Leaders around the world expressed sorrow and disgust at the attacks, with some deploring the demonisation of Muslims. U.S. President Donald Trump, who condemned the attack as a “horrible massacre”, was praised by the accused gunman in a manifesto posted online as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose”. Asked by a reporter in Washington if he thought white nationalism is a rising threat around the world, Trump said: “I don’t really. I think its a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand perhaps that’s a case, I don’t know enough about it yet.” Ardern, who flew to Christchurch on Saturday, said she had spoken to Trump, who had asked how he could help. “My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities,” she said she told him. Political and Islamic leaders across Asia and the Middle East voiced concern over the targeting of Muslims. “I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9-11,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan posted on social media. “1.3 billion Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror.” ‘Shotting everyone in the mosque’ One man who said he was at the Al Noor mosque told media the gunman burst into the mosque as worshippers were kneeling for prayers. “He had a big gun...He came and started shooting everyone in the mosque, everywhere,” said the man, Ahmad Al-Mahmoud. He said he and others escaped by breaking through a glass door. Facebook said, that having been alerted by police, it had deleted the gunman's accounts “shortly after the livestream commenced”. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all said they had taken steps to remove copies of the videos. Ardern said she had asked authorities to look into whether there was any activity on social media or elsewhere that could have alerted them ahead of the attack. Forty-one people were killed at the Al Noor mosque, seven at a mosque in the Linwood neighbourhood and one died in hospital, police said. Hospital officials said some of the wounded were in a critical condition. The visiting Bangladesh cricket team was arriving for prayers at one of the mosques when the shooting started but all members were safe, a team coach told Reuters. Muslims account for just over 1% of New Zealand's population, a 2013 census showed, most of whom were born overseas. A website set up for victims had raised more than NZ$1 million ($684,000) in less than a day, and social media was flooded with messages of shock, sympathy and solidarity. One image shared widely was of a cartoon kiwi, the country's national bird, weeping. Another showed a pair of figures, one in a headscarf, embracing. “This is your home and you should have been safe here” the caption read.

[unused1] [unused2] 1 killed, another hurt as sports car turns turtle near Kolkata Updated: Jun 03, 2018 18:44 IST A man on Sunday killed and his friend seriously injured when the sports car they were travelling in hit a divider and turned turtle at Domjur area of Howrah district. The vehicle, which was coming at a high speed from Dankuni, hit the divider while approaching a bridge on National Highway 6 at Domjur, an hour’s drive from Kolkata, and landed upside down on the ground with a thud, a senior police officer said. “Prima facie it seems that Shibaji Roy, a man in his early 30s, was driving the car. His friend Ashna Surana (21) was seated next to him,” he said. Both of them were pulled out of the mangled vehicle by local people with the help of police officers. “While Roy was declared dead on his arrival at a private hospital in Kolkata, Surana was admitted with serious injuries,” the officer said.

[unused1] [unused2] Truck-train collision kills six A speeding granite-laden truck rammed into the Bangalore-Nanded Express at a level crossing in Andhra Pradesh's Anantapur district on Monday, killing six persons, including a Congress MLA from Karnataka. Four bogies of the Nanded-bound train derailed as the truck broke the closed boom gate at Madakasira after "overlooking all safety warnings" and hit the S-1 coach at around 2.20am, the railways said. Venkatesh Naik, Congress MLA from Deodurg in Raichur district of Karnataka, was among four passengers killed, officials said. The truck's driver and the cleaner were also killed.

PTI picture shows a mangled coach of the express.
[unused1] [unused2] Two-year-old survives Audi-dumper crash in Delhi that killed his parents, grandmother When Sonu saw a dumper truck topple on top of an Audi in outer Delhi’s Rohini in the early hours of Wednesday, he didn’t believe that there would be any survivors in the car. An hour later though, he believes he witnessed a “miracle”. The three adult occupants of the car were crushed to death, but a two-year-old child was rescued with minor injuries. “Hundreds of us had gathered at the spot, but we were helpless. There was no way we could have pulled anyone out of the car. The truck and the soil it was carrying were too heavy for us,” said Sonu, who sleeps on the roadside and sells black salt on a cart. “We thought all inside the car were dead, but then, we heard the cries of a child and we were desperate to help the child,” Sonu said. According to Anurag (goes by a single name), a friend of the Singhal family that was involved in the mishap, a crane arrived about an hour later. The truck was removed and the car’s occupants were taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle. “Only the child was alive. The others looked dead,” Anurag said. Anurag happened to be at the spot as he was among several residents from the neighbourhood in Rohini Sector 15 who were returning from a wedding in Gurugram. “We were in Gurugram to attend the wedding of the daughter of our former neighbour, Rajesh Goyal. The Singhal family was among the attendees,” Anurag said. Anurag reached the accident spot just moments after the mishap. “The child survived because he was sleeping on the rear seat. The car’s roof probably did not crush him,” Anurag said. The child’s parents, Sumit Singhal and Ruchi Singhal, got married over three years ago. They lived with Sumit’s parents and his younger sister in their five-storey home in Rohini Sector 15. The family had rented out some floors, and also had a thriving pulses processing unit in Bawana. Overloading menace As most of the soil being carried by the dumper had landed on the road and the Audi, police said they are not in a position to determine if the “offending vehicle” was overloaded. But investigators said it was possible that the dumper was overloaded. “The truck must have been going at a high speed, and the load it was carrying may have caused it to topple over,” a senior police officer said. According to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the menace of overloading in goods vehicles has resulted in 817 mishaps and cost 141 lives in Delhi between 2015 and 2017. At the national level, overloading has been cited as the trigger for 1,94,153 mishaps and 67,349 deaths in the three years between 2015 and 2017. In that period, these mishaps accounted for anywhere between 11.9% and 15.4% of all accidents in India. In terms of deaths, overloading accounted for around 15% of all fatalities. Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (Delhi traffic police), said his personnel cannot prosecute goods vehicles for overloading. “We do not have the facility for weighing trucks and their goods because of which we cannot determine if they are overloaded,” the JCP said.

[unused1] [unused2] Nine suspects planned terror attacks in Mumbai: ATS MUMBAI: The suspects arrested for their alleged inclination .. towards the international terror outfit, IS, were planning to target some locations in Aurangabad,Mumbai and other parts of the country, said an officer of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Monday. Nine suspects were arrested and a minor detained from Aurangabad and Mumbra recently for allegedly planning to carry out terror strikes. The ATS was monitoring the activities of the suspects, following which the vigilance was increased manifold. The reason for choosing to target select locations in certain cities is also being analysed. A communication regarding the same has been passed on to the state, following which the security has been beefed up at vital installations, said the officer, who was part of the team that made the arrests. “We can say they were in the planning stage at the time of being arrested.” Sources said that from August 2018, the ATS successfully collected information about the suspects and their activities with the help of technical surveillance combined with human intelligence. The ATS got the first input about the suspects from Mumbra, following which their connection to Aurangabad came to fore. The suspects’ plan to attack select locations in Mumbai and Aurangabad was pecifically mentioned in a complaint lodged by an ATS officer at the ATS police station at Kala Chowkie in Mumbai on January 22. Confirming the development, a senior officer said, “The targets identified by the suspects in these cities cannot be revealed at this stage.” The probe also reveals that the suspect from Mumbra was the first to get inspired by IS ideology and started bringing others into the fold without even informing them about the direction in which they were being driven. The officer said that all details extracted from the suspects were being verified and cross-verified before taking them on record. “The suspects may even try to mislead the investigation team.Hence, ATS is busy cross-verifying every detail obtained from the suspects and keeping every information under the wraps,” he said. Around 20 teams of the state ATS carried out a series of raids in Aurangabad and Mumbra in Thane and arrested nine suspects including a 17-year-old. These arrests were followed by another raid on Saturday in which a 24-year-old from Mumbra was arrested. Four of the suspects are close relatives.
[unused1] [unused2] Tracks damaged, expect Central Railway travel woes today too TNN | Updated: Aug 5, 2019, 6:42 IST MUMBAI: The overflowing Ulhas and Mithi rivers flooded Central Railway tracks and derailed services—both Harbour as well Main—for almost all of Sunday. Though Main line services between CSMT and Thane were restored later in the evening, there was no train on the Kalyan-Karjat stretch. Harbour line services could be fully restored only late in the night. CR chief spokesperson Sunil Udasi said, “Services beyond Badlapur will not run on Monday due to damage to tracks. We will take a call on the rest later.” Soil under tracks washed away On Sunday, the afternoon high tide meant that water accumulated along tracks in the morning did not recede till evening. Officials were posted at Sion to measure flooding on tracks and give reports. “Mithi water gushed on to tracks at Sion and Chunabhatti. Water at Sion rose up to 8 inches. In Kalyan and Badlapur, Ulhas river caused waterlogging. The floods washed away tracks at several places near Badlapur and the entire line at Karjat. The signal system too was damaged. There were also landslides at Kasara,” an official said. “We suspended services on all corridors at 7.40am on Sunday,” he added. However, CR commuters found themselves waiting at stations at any point of the day. “It is frustrating not to see a single train on platform,” said A Vora, who takes a train from Thane. On WR, services were suspended between Vasai and Virar for seven hours. WR remained afloat as it runs through western suburbs which are located at a height as compared to CR that runs through low-lying areas and along river banks. Meanwhile, at LTT, 2,000 were stranded due to non-availability of trains. L ward officer Manish Valanju asked his team to provide food and tea to the passengers.

[unused1] [unused2] Major fire accident on Vattamalaikarai reservoir TNN | Aug 27, 2018, 12.05 AM IST Tirupur: A major fire broke out on dried up Vattamalaikarai reservoir filled with bushes and vegetation near Vellakoil on Sunday. The fire and rescue personnel struggled for more than three hours to douse the blaze. The Vattamalaikarai reservoir was constructed in Uthamapalayam in 1980 to store surplus water from Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) irrigation scheme. But for the past two decades, the reservoir has not received water. The 650-acre waterbody is now filled with bushes and vegetation. On Sunday morning, Vellakoil fire and rescue service team received information about the fire accident. “We received the alert an hour after the fire broke out. When we reached, the fire had spread across several acres of the reservoir. With 12 firefighters and a few villagers, it took more than three hours to douse the fire, which had spread across 70 acres,” said a firefighter. “Since the fire was on the centre of the reservoir, we could not take the fire tender beyond certain distance. We utilized palm leaves and other things to put off the fire,” he added. Meanwhile, farmers were worried that the fire accident would affect deer and other animals that have taken shelter inside the reservoir. They blamed anti-social elements who consume alcohol on the reservoir for the fire accident.
[unused1] [unused2] plush dombivli township built on flood plains of river goes under Pradeep Gupta | TNN | Updated: Aug 5, 2019, 7:11 IST MUMBAI: Sunil More's bungalow in Palava City (Phase 1) in Dombivli looked like it was built inside a pool. Around 6am, water had started seeping in and within a couple of hours, the ground floor was inundated. "We were forced to move to the first floor with a few belongings for basic survival," More said. As the day progressed and the incessant rain continued, power supply to the entire Phase 1 of the housing complex was switched off. "Water had entered the electrical meter box," said More. The situation in phase 1 of Palava City Township was grim with many confined to their buildings due to the flood-like situation. Some of the affected buildings were Casa Bella, Casa Rio and the bungalows of Meadow Green. The area around Phase II of the township was also flooded. Vehicles were submerged at Palava City ( see pics alongside), which is spread over 4,500 acres. Constructed by the Lodha Group, the complex stands on the flood plains of river Mothali. The project was touted as a gated township with riverfront views. A resident said some lucky ones managed to save their vehicles from damage during the downpour by parking them on higher ground before their building compounds get flooded. Another resident said "nearly half" of Phase-I was flooded with water reaching a height of 5 feet. Residents were "caught between the devil and the deep sea", said a resident who refused to be identified. "We had a tough time as we were holed up in our homes. And we could not even step out of the building," said this resident. The management of the housing complex tried to drain out water using pumps. A spokesperson of the Palava City expressed inability to give their comment on Sunday. Environmentalist Rupali Shailwale pointed out that Palava City has sprung up in a "low-lying" area. "Also we have to remember that it has been built on the bank of a river," said Shailwale. "If we play with the environment by constructing along a riverside, such man-made disasters could recur. Also, dumping of plastic waste in the river results in such a display of nature's fury."
[unused1] [unused2] 50 dead in suicide bomb attack at Nigeria mosque Kano: A suicide bomber has killed at least 50 people at a mosque in the north-eastern Nigerian town of Mubi, police say. The teenage bomber detonated his explosives early on Tuesday in Adamawa state as people were arriving for morning prayers. Police spokesman Othman Abubakar said that the young man was mingling among the worshippers. Ahmed Musa, chairman of Mubi council, said dozens of people had been injured. Police were "still trying to ascertain the number of injured because they are in various hospitals", Mr Abubakar said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack bears the hallmark of Boko Haram, which typically mounts suicide attacks in crowded public places, such as mosques and markets. Tuesday's attack is the highest loss of life since 18 people were killed in neighbouring Borno state in September. Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in north-east Nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an Islamic state in the region, killing more than 20,000 and forcing about 2 million people to flee their homes. Most attacks by the group focus on Borno state, the birthplace of the insurgency. The group held a swathe of land around the size of Belgium in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states until early 2015, but were forced out by Nigeria's army backed by troops from neighbouring countries
[unused1] [unused2] Mudslide in southern Chile kills five, at least 15 missing A mudslide on Saturday tore through a small village in southern Chile near a popular national park, leaving five people dead and at least 15 missing after a night of torrential downpours, authorities said. A video taken from a helicopter by Chilean police showed a vast swath of the remote town of Villa Santa Lucia, near Chaiten in coastal Patagonia, buried beneath the mud as the landslide plowed its way down a flooded river valley. Four Chileans and a male tourist whose name and nationality have not been disclosed were died in the mudslide, authorities said. Rescue workers were continuing to search through the debris for at least 15 people. The mudslide also destroyed a school and several homes and roadways as well as a voting center ahead of Chile´s presidential election on Sunday. President Michelle Bachelet declared the area a disaster zone. “I have ordered rescue workers to put all the necessary resources toward protecting the people of Villa Santa Lucia,” she said on social media. More than 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) of rain fell in 24 hours, the country’s Interior Ministry said, but weather conditions were expected to improve later in the day. Villa Santa Lucia borders Chile’s Corcovado National Park, a popular tourist region of volcanoes, fjords and vast forests. The nearby Chaiten volcano erupted in 2008, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents.
[unused1] [unused2] Mumbai: No power at hospital, 3 patients taken out in boats TNN | Updated: Aug 5, 2019, 9:15 IST MUMBAI: Three patients in critical condition were rescued from a hospital without electricity in Kalyan on Friday night. The fire brigade had to take the patients, who were admitted to the ICU, in boats as the area around the hospital was flooded. On Sunday, power to Fortis Hospital was disconnected due to heavy rains and flooding. Dilip Find, chief fire officer of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), said, "The hospital's generator fitted outside the hospital also got flooded. We got a call about patients being critical and requiring to be shifted out. We sent our team and using boat, shifted the patients to safe places from where the hospital transferred them to their Mulund branch." Fortis hospital, in an official statement, said backup generators enabled our teams to work round the clock to provide required medical care and safeguard our patients. "Fortis ambulances were made available immediately to shift the three patients to Mulund. Other patients are stable and are being looked after by our medical teams. Police, traffic, KDMC, disaster management teams and local authorities are helping us immensely," read the statement. Meanwhile, the downpour coupled with flooding caused power cuts for hours in several parts of Mumbai region even as cables were waterlogged and substations damaged. Vasai was worst affected with day-long outage. An MSEDCL official said, "A 100 MVA substation at Vasai was waterlogged. It affected over 1.5 lakh consumers since 6.30am. Around 1.30pm, an alternate feed was used to supply power to close to 30 lakh consumers. Officials are working to restore supply." A Vasai resident said, "There is a substation in the middle of salt pans. So each time, water collects in the salt pans, power is switched off as a precaution." Other areas that witnessed power cuts were Kalyan-Karjat and Kalyan-Badlapur belts. Due to water-logging and the overflowing Ulhas river, all four electricity feeders from Sonivali substations were switched off," said an official. When residents called up at the power utility firm to complain, they were told "it was due to waterlogging". A source in a power utility firm said in most cases, it was local cable fault and there was no major outage in the suburbs.
[unused1] [unused2] Four killed in accidents in Mahabubnagar Three youths, two of them techies, met a tragic end when the Sports Utility Vehicle they were travelling in rammed a culvert under construction at Nallagattu village, nearly 180 km from here, on Mahabubnagar-Raichur national highway on Monday. The victims Kameshwar Rao, 25, Manikantha, 25, and the latter’s brother Mahesh, 23, were from Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh. Rao and Manikantha were software professionals in Hyderabad while Mahesh took up part-time employment while pursuing his studies, Makthal Inspector G. Venkat said.

Two of the passengers got flung out of the SUV while one sitting on the front seat got crushed in the mangled vehicle. Death was instant for them. “We are registering a case against the road contractor as he failed to put up any signboards hinting about the road work which is the normal practice,” Narayanapet DSP G.

State institutions in charge of migration and asylum issues are operating in a care-taking capacity.
[unused1] [unused2] Fire safety dept. for demolition of godown The Fire and Safety Department will recommend the demolition of the six-storey footwear godown near the Ernakulam Junction (South) railway station that was gutted in a major fire last week. A recommendation to that effect citing structural instability will be part of the report that the department is likely to submit to the District Collector on Tuesday. The report will also list out the alleged violations that led to the incident in the heart of the city. ‘Lack of maintenance’ “A complete lack of maintenance of the fire safety system aggravated the situation. While the pumps and related equipment were in place, the overhead and underground water tanks meant for aiding fire fighting were empty. The fire extinguishers were past their expiry period,” a senior fire force official told The Hindu. NOC for building He said while the Fire and Safety Department had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) for shop-cum-residence occupancy to the building in 2006, the owners had changed the occupancy status to godown despite the fact that godowns were not permissible at such a height. Besides, material far exceeding the capacity of the building were stored inside, he added. However, senior officials with the Public Works Department (PWD) said the department had not yet been asked to inspect the building. Detailed probe Meanwhile, the Electrical Inspectorate Department has set in motion a process to carry out a detailed investigation into the incident after a preliminary inspection of the site held last Friday. A deputy assistant electrical inspector has been entrusted with the inquiry. “We will have to record the statement of the building owner, those who were present in the building on the day of the accident, and electrical engineer of the building. Besides, statement of KSEB officials will also have to be taken since it was reported that power supply to the building was switched off for line maintenance that day,” said Electrical Inspectorate sources.
[unused1] [unused2] Travel travails: Getting public transport was a challenge TNN | Updated: Aug 5, 2019, 8:00 IST MUMBAI: The heavy rains hit public transport on Sunday. While BEST plied fewer buses, many of them—at least 23 buses—faced breakdowns. Of these, 10 buses were stuck on waterlogged roads and were later removed. On a day when railway services were majorly disrupted on the central main and Harbour lines, the BEST buses were not adequate for commuters who wanted to travel from the suburbs to south Mumbai and other destinations, sources said. A senior official denied this, saying, “The BEST plied buses outside railway stations as the train services were not operational during daytime. We catered to those stranded.” Booking an aggregator cab was a painful experience for many commuters. “I tried to book a cab from Vikhroli to CSMT, but the app showed it was searching for two drivers and the booking finally got cancelled automatically. When I finally managed to book one, it was for nearly double the fare,” said a female commuter. Fearing their vehicles might get stuck in the rains or break down, few kaali-peeli drivers ventured out. Similarly, the auto population was also down by half as compared to normal days. Refusals were rampant, but those on share routes plied as usual, recalled a commuter. Outside Mumbai, landslides were reported on Kasara Ghat road on the Mumbai-Nashik highway on Sunday evening. Traffic was affected till the time of going to press.

Fortunately, the staff members of the scrap market and the godown were sleeping outside the premises and nobody sustained any injuries due to the fire. While the prima facie cause of the fire seems to be a short circuit, the exact cause is yet to be determined, the fire officials said. A senior MC official said that a report on the incident has been sought from concerned officials and the action will be taken once the report has been submitted. Meanwhile, the Chandigarh MC has started fire safety inspection of coaching centres, liquor vends and commercial establishments, with notices already having been issued to around 250 coaching centres and over 30 liquor vends.

[unused1] [unused2] 1 killed, 8 injured as cluster bus rams multiple vehicles in Delhi delhi Updated: Jul 16, 2019 05:29 IST A 65-year-old woman was killed and eight others injured after the driver of a cluster bus, which was allegedly speeding, lost control of the vehicle and rammed eight vehicles before hitting the road divider and coming to halt on central Delhi’s Desh Bandhu Gupta (DBG) Road near Anand Parbat Monday morning. The vehicles that were hit by the bus included three auto-rickshaws, three motorcycles and two e-rickshaws. The elderly woman, Bhago Devi from Karol Bagh, was seated in an e-rickshaw. The errant driver and conductor tried to flee but were chased and caught by locals. They thrashed the duo before handing them over to the police. Police said a case of rash driving and death by negligence was registered against the driver, Joginder Singh,48. Singh claimed that the bus had a brake failure because of which he lost control of the vehicle. “We have sent the bus for a mechanical inspection to verify the claims of the driver. The driver’s medical examination confirmed that he was not drunk at the time of mishap. He was later released on bail,” a police officer, associated with the case, said. Police said the cluster bus (route number 212), plying between Nand Nagri and Anand Parbat, was headed towards its final destination when the mishap took place around 8am. Locals told the police that the bus was speeding and swerving on the crowded road and kept brushing against other vehicles. “Some eyewitnesses told us that the bus dragged at least eight vehicles for almost 100 metres before it hit the road divider and stopped. A few of them were badly damaged. At least nine people were injured and were rushed to a nearby hospital where the elderly woman succumbed to injuries,” the officer said. Police said they are also probing if the same bus was involved in another accident in north Delhi’s Wazirpur, as someone had clicked the photograph of a cluster bus and uploaded it on the traffic police website a few hours before the Anand Parbat accident.
[unused1] [unused2] 25 killed in Bangla factory blaze A fire at a food and cigarette packaging factory in Bangladesh killed at least 25 people and injured over 70 today, in the country's worst industrial accident since the Rana Plaza building collapse of 2013 in which over 1,100 people died. Emergency officials feared the death toll could climb after a fire broke out in the Tongi Industrial Zone about 20km north of Dhaka. The cause was not immediately known, but officials said a boiler explosion probably triggered the blaze at around 0200 GMT as workers prepared to swap shifts. "There were about 100 people inside the building when fire broke out," Mohammad Nayan, a worker who was helping with rescue efforts, told reporters. Officials at the site said over 20 fire fighting teams were working to quell the blaze at the Tampaco Foils plant, which caused the partial collapse of the factory building. "We cannot confirm whether any people are inside or not, but our priority is to rescue them if there is anyone inside," Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman, a fire department official at the site, told Reuters over the phone. Another fire official said that although the blaze was under control, there were still flames inside the building so fire fighters had been unable to search the debris. A manager at Tampaco Foils said he did not know how many people were inside the factory when the blaze broke out. "Now my only focus is on my workers who were injured and on those who died. We will take care of them," said Syed Mokbul Hossain, chair of Tampaco and a former MP. "My company is fully compliant and I've never sacrificed on quality, as my clients are mainly multinational companies." Tampaco's website says its clients include several local companies and global brands including British American Tobacco and Nestle. Fire department officials initially identified the factory as a garment packaging plant, but later clarified that it packs food and cigarettes. The fire will further tarnish the industrial safety record of one of the world's top garment exporters. In the Rana Plaza disaster, 1,135 mainly garment industry workers were killed when a building collapsed outside Dhaka. That sparked demands for greater safety in the country. The disaster led to the creation of two international coalitions designed to help fund improvements to building and fire safety at thousands of garment factories across Bangladesh. "So far our focus was only on readymade garment factories, but now this disaster has opened our eyes to the fact that we should also focus on other factories," Syed Ahmed, the head of the Department of Inspection for factories in Bangladesh, told Reuters. Militant shot dead Bangladesh police today shot dead a militant who played a key role in carrying out the cafe siege, and injured three other women terrorists in a gunfight.

[unused1] [unused2] Colombia: At least 21 dead in car bombing at police academy, say officials President Ivan Duque declared three days of mourning after the attack, which was the deadliest in years against a police or military target in Colombia. Colombian authorities said the death toll from a car bombing at a police academy in the capital has risen to 21. The police in a statement said that 10 of 68 people injured by Thursday’s blast remain hospitalized. Authorities have yet to identify what armed group was likely behind the attack. But they said a 56-year-old man named Jose Aldemar Rojas drove a 1993 Nissan pick-up loaded with 80 kilograms (175 pounds) of explosive past a security checkpoint to carry out the attack. Colombian authorities were scrambling to identify who was behind a brazen car bombing at a police academy in Bogota that has rattled residents and raised tough questions about lingering security threats in the wake of a peace deal with the nation’s largest rebel group. The Thursday morning bombing was the deadliest in Bogota in years and proved especially unsettling because the target, the General Santander school in southern Bogota, is one of the most protected installations in the capital. President Ivan Duque, visiting the academy in the aftermath, was careful not to attribute blame to any armed group even while condemning what he called a “miserable” terrorist act that recalled some of bloodiest chapters of Colombia’s recent past.

[unused1] [unused2] Major fire guts stalls at industrial exhibition in Hyderabad, 9 hospitalised Hundreds of shops were gutted in a major fire at the All India Industrial Exhibition being held at the Exhibition Grounds at Nampally in Hyderabad on Wednesday night. Nine persons have been hospitalised. Seven people who complained of suffocation due to heavy smoke were rushed to the Osmania General Hospital, while two others who received minor burns were shifted to Care Hospitals in Nampally. Their condition was later stated to be stable. The fire was brought under control and there were no casualties, Musharraf Farooqi, Zonal Commissioner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, said. Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited managing director NVS Reddy announced that the Metro would offer free transport to people from Nampally since the roads were blocked. The premises, popularly known as Numaish, was packed with thousands of people who thronged the exhibition to spend their evening for shopping and recreation. Police sources said the fire broke out in the stall of Andhra Pradesh Mahesh Cooperative Bank Limited at around 8.45 pm, apparently due to short circuit and spread to several adjacent stalls. There were nearly 3,000 big and small stalls in the exhibition and more than 800 stalls are learnt to have been gutted in the fire. Since the stalls were made of bamboo sheets and cloth, they caught fire immediately resulting in huge flames and smoke started billowing in the entire area. Even electric transformers erected for the exhibition also reportedly caught fire. Panic-stricken visitors, comprising women and children, started running out of the grounds, resulting in a mild stampede. However, police personnel and exhibition volunteers brought the crowd under control and sent them out of the grounds through various gates all around the premises. Meanwhile, 10 fire tenders were rushed to the spot to put out the fire. “The authorities have responded immediately and are in the process of extinguishing fire. Luckily, there are no reports of any casualties,” Exhibition Society chairman Eatala Rajender told the media. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s (GHMC) disaster management team rushed to the spot to take up rescue operations. “It is a massive fire accident and we are in the process of estimating the damage. Since hundreds of stalls caught fire, it takes longer time to extinguish the fire,” Hyderabad mayor Bonthu Rammohan, who rushed to the spot, said.

Both cars were dragged for more than 50 metres. After that there were only screams and shouts,” said Palak. She was among the first to be rescued and taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala. It was on her statement that the FIR was lodged. Sitting at her house in Sector 30, she said, “There was only me that was conscious. I was repeatedly shouting for help.

[unused1] [unused2] Thane: 2 dead as car crashes into pole, flips thrice A short car drive to have pani puri after a pre-wedding function cost two people their lives, as the vehicle rammed into a pole, flipped thrice and hit a divider at Ghodbunder Road in Thane on Thursday. According to the police, the six men, all relatives, had gone for a pre-marriage function of their kin at Manpada on Wednesday evening. “As the function got over around 12.30am, the six of them decided to have pani puri at an eatery that was 8km away,” said Ashok Wagh, investigating officer from Kapurbawdi police station. As they reached Manpada bridge, one km away from the event venue, the driver, Shailesh Patil, 31, lost control over the vehicle. “The road was clear and the car was at high speed. It crashed into a pole and overturned,” Wagh said. Passers-by alerted the control room, after which a police team reached the spot. “Local residents rushed the six men to a nearby private hospital. Arjun Pardhi, 33, and Ankush Chandwade, 29, who were sitting behind the driver’s seat, succumbed during the treatment.

[unused1] [unused2] Noida sees 2 road accidents, one casualty every day, shows data While several departments of the Noida authority have been observing the annual road safety week, with awareness and challan drives, the result seems negligible, according to police data, which shows that traffic-related accidents and deaths are consistently on the rise. According to official records, on average, there are at least two incidents and one death every day in Noida due to road accidents. The total number of accidents in Noida was 933 in 2015 and 926 in 2016. This grew to 1,043 in 2017 and 1,067 in 2018. The total number of fatalities in these accidents also grew, from 362 in 2015 to 382 in 2016, 423 in 2017 and 452 in 2018. A similar increase can be seen in the number of injured persons as well. Officials said that the maximum number of accidents take place along expressways. Noida has a large share of expressways and state highways passing through the city. “Most accidents are because of speeding on high speed corridors such as expressways and state highways. Approximately 5% of roads in Noida are highways, which is higher than the share in other cities,” Anil Kumar Jha, superintendent of police (traffic), said. He said the increase in accidents can also be correlated with the increasing vehicular population of the city and vehicles visiting the city. He added that while the number of casualties is increasing at the rate of 6.8% in Noida, number of vehicles passing through is increasing at a rate of 20-25% every year. “In the past few years, the condition of roads in Noida as well as across Uttar Pradesh has also improved. However, it is ironic that even as roads improved, it led to increased speed and therefore, more accidents. We are trying to deal with it by surveying the most vulnerable spots, following which we will inform people about them,” Jha said. He said that the maximum number of traffic violations in the city is due to speeding, driving on the wrong side, and not wearing helmets and seat belts. Therefore, awareness drives during the road safety week are essential for improving driver behaviour and road discipline in Gautam Budh Nagar, he added. Meanwhile, though several activities are planned for the ongoing road safety week, residents said such superficial activities do not help with road safety on the streets. Residents said it would help more if officials would make changes in road design and increase enforcement activities against traffic violators. “The e-challans may be increasing but we don’t see much impact on ground. Driving on the wrong side causes several accidents but no action is taken. Most roads see heavy traffic because of encroachment and illegal parking by vendors and auto-rickshaws. However, we don’t see action against any of these violators,” Manish Kumar, a resident of Greater Noida, said.

[unused1] [unused2] Baby pulled alive in Russia from ruins of apartment block A baby boy has been found alive after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble of a Russian apartment block that partially collapsed in an explosion, emergency officials reported, calling it a miracle. The blast, thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk on Monday, killing at least seven people with 36 people still missing. Video footage from the local emergency ministry showed a rescuer worker removing the baby dressed in pink socks and putting a blanket around it before he starts running towards an ambulance. The current temperature in the city of Magnitogorsk, home to one of Russia's largest steel plants in the Urals some 1,700 km east of Moscow, is -17°Celsius. The fact that the 11-month-old infant, currently diagnosed with a serious freezer burn and a closed-head injury, was lying in his bed and was wrapped up in layers saved his life, TASS news agency reported, citing a regional emergency centre. The baby was found when a rescuer heard him crying and “a large-scale operation was immediately organised,” Interfax news agency reported, citing emergency officials. His removal was difficult because of unstable debris which posed risks for rescuers. “Hundreds of people were waiting for the appearance of the injured child from under the rubble like a miracle. And the miracle happened...,” the officials were quoted as saying by Interfax. “Tears drew in the eyes of the weatherbeaten rescuers.” The boy's mother is alive and has already arrived to the hospital, Interfax added. The blast tore through the building in the city of Magnitogorsk, home of one of Russia's largest steel plants, early on Monday morning, a public holiday in Russia, when many residents were asleep. Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said on Monday that the chances of finding survivors were fading.

[unused1] [unused2] Kerala journalist killed in accident, IAS officer accused of driving the car A senior journalist was killed in an accident after his motorcycle was rammed at high speed by a car in which Survey and Land Records Director Sriram Venkitaraman was travelled. The incident took a curious turn after eye-witnesses claimed that the IAS official drove the car, even as the police claimed otherwise. K.M. Basheer, 35, the Thiruvananthapuram bureau chief of Malayalam daily Siraj, died in the accident that took place outside the Public Office complex, a short distance away from the Museum police station at around 1 a.m. on Saturday. Despite being rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital, his life could not be saved. Opposing narratives The purported delay on the part of the police in initiating legal proceedings has raised eyebrows with allegations rife that efforts were on to protect those responsible for the incident. The police initially claimed that the car was driven by its owner, Wafa Firoze of Marappalam, while Dr. Venkitaraman sat on the passenger seat. However, two auto-rickshaw drivers — Shafeeq and Manikuttan, who claimed to have witnessed the incident — told media persons that it was the IAS official who drove the vehicle. They also claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of incident. Medical tests delayed The failure of the police to subject the passengers to medical test soon after the accident has also been questioned. Initially, Ms. Firoze was purportedly sent home in a taxi from the accident scene. She was later summoned by the Museum police and subjected to a medical test. Dr. Venkitaraman, who was admitted to the General Hospital with a minor hand injury, allegedly refused to undergo tests. Later, while he was referred to the Government Medical College Hospital, he chose to seek treatment in a private hospital in the city. Additional Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram, Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, said that there were certain legal formalities to be followed when a person refuses to undergo medical tests. Nonetheless, the examination will be conducted shortly, he said.

[unused1] [unused2] Youth falls to death from bridge after car rams into his bike mumbai Updated: Jun 10, 2019 04:23 IST A 22-year-old biker fell to death and the pillion rider was injured when a car rammed into a bike on the accident-prone U-bridge in Bandra (West) early on Sunday. The car’s driver Akshit Prakash Nahar,20, who is a college student, has been arrested. The biker has been identified as Shahid Khan. According to the Bandra police, Khan was a resident of Malwani. He used to do odd jobs for a living. According to Arbaz Khan, the pillion rider, who is the complainant in the case, he and Khan left Mahim dargah at 3.10 am on Sunday to visit Bandstand in Bandra (West).

Girish Anavarkar, senior police inspector of Bandra police station, said Nahar was speeding and could not control his car in time, causing the collision and hence was negligent. Asked about Arbaz’s claim that several bikers had been driving in the wrong direction, Anavarkar said, “That is being investigated.” Nahar was arrested under relevant sections of the IPC.

[unused1] [unused2] Two sisters killed as speeding truck hits ambulance in Gurugram Two sisters, on their way to a hospital in an ambulance, were killed after a speeding truck hit their vehicle near Kherki Daula toll plaza in Gurugram in the early hours of Friday, police said. Their brother, who was also with them in the ambulance at the time, said the force of the crash was such that the elder sister was thrown out of vehicle and was crushed underneath the truck. The truck driver fled the spot and raids are underway to arrest him, police said. The sisters, identified by the police only by their first names Baby (25) and Sonam (17), were on their way to Gurugram’s Civil Hospital from Manesar. The family hails from a village in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and had been living in a rented house in village Kasan in IMT Manesar the past five months. They were both employed as helps in different companies in IMT Manesar. Police said Sonam had spiked a fever on Thursday night and her brother, 36-year-old Pramod Kumar, said he decided to accompany her to a private hospital in Manesar. Kumar, who works as a driver, said the doctors at that hospital told them to go Civil Hospital in Gurugram. “At 1.30 am, we left in an ambulance provided by the private hospital. I sat in the co-driver’s seat with my seven-year-old daughter while my sisters were in the rear,” said Kumar. Charan Singh, assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Kherki Daula police station, said a speeding truck allegedly hit the ambulance from behind near Kherki Daula toll plaza at around 2.15am. “The collision took place 60 metres before the toll plaza as the ambulance entered one of the toll lanes... Due to the impact of the collision, one of the window panes of the ambulance was shattered and the rear door of the ambulance was thrown open. The elder sister, Baby, fell out of the ambulance and was crushed underneath the truck’s rear tyre. She died on the spot,” Singh said. The younger sister, Sonam, was wounded and another ambulance was called in to rush her to Civil Hospital. “She was declared dead on arrival. The other occupants of the ambulance — Kumar, his daughter and the ambulance driver — suffered minor bruises. The truck’s driver abandoned the vehicle and escaped,” said, ASI Singh, adding that the errant vehicle was registered in Nagaland. Police said at least eight trucks were present at the toll plaza at the time and a police party, which was stationed about a kilometre from the area, rushed to the spot. The truck was impounded and raids were on to trace the accused driver. “I just wished to get the best treatment possible for my sister. In the process of taking one of my sisters to the hospital, I ended up losing both,” he lamented. A case was registered against the unidentified accused driver under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304-A (death by negligence) and 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code at Kherki Daula police station, officials said.
[unused1] [unused2] Cyclone Idai hits Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, killing 150 HARARE: Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi have been hit by a vicious cyclone that has killed nearly 150 people, left hundreds more missing and stranded tens of thousands who are cut off from roads and telephones in mainly poor, rural areas. Cyclone Idai has affected more than 1.5 million people in the three southern African countries, according to the UN and government officials. Hardest hit is Mozambique's central port city of Beira where the airport is closed, electricity is out and many homes have been destroyed. The storm hit Beira late Thursday and moved westward into Zimbabwe and Malawi, affecting thousands more, particularly in eastern areas bordering Mozambique. Homes, schools, businesses, hospitals and police stations have been destroyed by the cyclone. Thousands were marooned by the heavy flooding and, only caring for their lives, abandoned their possessions to seek safety on higher ground. UN agencies and the Red Cross are helping with rescue efforts that include delivering food supplies and medicines by helicopter in the impoverished southern African countries. Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi said the damage is ``very worrisome'' and said that the flooding made it difficult for aircraft to land and carry out rescue operations, according to Mozambique's state radio. In Zimbabwe, 31 people have died from the floods so far, according to the government. The deaths are mainly in Zimbabwe's Chimanimani, a mountainous area along the eastern border with Mozambique that is popular with tourists. No tourist deaths were recorded, said government spokesman Nick Mangwana. Roads and bridges were swept away, slowing rescue efforts by the military, government agencies and non-governmental organizations, he said. The dead included two school students who were among dozens of children trapped in a dormitory after rocks fell from a nearby mountain, said Mangwana. Zimbabwe's military is trying to rescue the 197 students at the school, although unsafe conditions are forcing the soldiers to use ground efforts rather than attempt an air rescue, the government's ministry of information said later. Zimbabwe state television station, ZBC, reported that 150 people are missing. ``We are receiving tragic reports of some people being swept away. We urge patience as rescue is on its way,'' Zimbabwe's information ministry said in a tweet, although power cuts and communications breakdown in affected areas means the warning might reach just a few. In Malawi, people ``are now facing a second threat of flash floods'' following the cyclone, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on Twitter. South Africa's military has sent in aircraft and 10 medical personnel to help in Mozambique and Malawi, it said in a statement Saturday.

[unused1] [unused2] Car catches fire in east Delhi; woman, two daughters killed delhi Updated: Mar 11, 2019 08:55 IST A 35-year-old woman and her two children — a five-year-old and a toddler — were killed on Sunday evening when the car they were travelling in caught fire on a flyover close to the Akshardham Temple in east Delhi. The woman’s husband and their four-year-old daughter, who were sitting in the front, survived. While fire department officials could not confirm the exact cause of the fire, a leak from the compressed natural gas (CNG) is the prime suspect. Police identified the victims as Ranjana Mishra and her daughters Ridhi (5) and Nikki. The incident took place at around 6.30 pm when the family were heading to their home in Ghaziabad’s Loni. While Upendra Mishra was driving the car, a Datsun Go, his daughter sat beside him in the passenger seat. The other three were sitting on the back seat, close to the CNG tank installed in the boot. Chief fire officer from the Delhi Fire Service, Atul Garg, said the department received reports of a car on fire. “We rushed two fire tenders, a rescue responder and a disaster van to the spot. The fire was doused by our men but by then the occupants of the rear seat had died. The entire car was gutted,” he said. “The car had a CNG kit installed in the boot. The fire is suspected to have started from there. However, the exact reason is yet to be ascertained.” Upendra Mishra said that they was heading home after a visit to a Kalkaji temple. “I don’t understand what happened. I don’t know how car caught fire,” he said before he left for Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital where the bodies were shifted for autopsy. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that, prima facie, the source of the fire was the CNG kit installed in the car. “The man works for an online used car selling company. The car belonged to Upendra Mishra but he had also attached it to his company. The probable cause of fire is CNG cylinder which caught fire. We have not questioned Upendra Mishra yet. We are investigating the matter,” he said. “The fire was massive,” said Raj Kumar, an autorickshaw driver who said he tried to help rescue the woman and children. “Many people gathered around the car. Police also blocked traffic on the road to prevent any other vehicle from catching fire.”

[unused1] [unused2] Maharashtra: Four killed in accident, mob sets 18 trucks on fire A fatal accident between a truck and a state transport bus in Gadchiroli on Wednesday allegedly led to an incident of arson in which 18 trucks that had come to a halt on that route were set ablaze. Advertising Police said four persons, including a teenager, were killed and three critically injured when a truck operating for the Surjagad iron ore mine rammed into a bus, travelling from Etapalli to Aheri, at 9 am. Later, police added, a mob of 1,500 came from nearby villages and set fire to trucks that had come to a halt on that route due to the accident. “The accident took place around 9 am near Etapalli town. For about two hours, the situation was normal. But later, a mob of about 1,500 came from nearby villages and set fire to several trucks that had come to a halt following the accident. About 14 trucks were gutted,” Additional Superintendent of Police Hari Balaji told The Indian Express. He added, “After the mishap, the other trucks stopped and their drivers ran away taking their keys with them. That’s why the trucks couldn’t be removed.” Those who were killed in the accident were identified as Amol Gawde (17), Shyamala Gajbhiye (47), Prakash Ambade (50) and Manjusha Kurpe (52). Among the injured is the driver of the bus, Hemant Pulliwar.

In December 2017, Naxals had set ablaze 80 trucks at the mine site, following which the company was provided police security. However, the mine hasn’t been able to operate beyond seven days in any given month. Sources said, “in the past three months, excavation happened for two days and transport of the material for about three days after that as no security is available on all the days.” Balaji said, “a police post has been sanctioned just about a week ago for Surjagad but manpower sanction, too, has to be there. We have to man a corridor of about 65 km between the mine and Alapalli town for which we require 750 personnel. There are five posts in between. So, for a jawan from each of those posts, it means a daily walk of about 20 km. Naturally, it can’t be provided on daily basis. Yet, we manage it for at least seven days every month. If we do it daily, we will not be able to do other operations like area domination.”

[unused1] [unused2] Denmark train accident kills 6, injures 16 Danish passenger train apparently hit falling cargo from a passing freight train Wednesday, an accident that killed six people and injured 16 others as it crossed a bridge linking the country's islands, authorities said. The accident was the worst in Denmark in more than 30 years. The rail operator, Danish Railways, told Denmark's TV2 that the victims were passengers on a train going from the city of Odense, on the central Danish island of Funen, to the capital of Copenhagen when the accident took place about 8 am. Authorities said the trains were going past each other in opposite directions. Aerial TV footage showed one side of the passenger train had been ripped open. Photos showed that the freight train was carrying crates of beer, and the tarpaulin that covered the cargo train was torn in pieces. Police declined to comment directly on a report from Denmark's TV2 channel that a large freight container had likely fallen off the cargo train. Jesper Nielsen, who was on the passenger train, told Denmark's TV2 that the train "was out on the bridge when there was a huge 'bang' ... very quickly thereafter, the train braked." "It is much too early to speculate as to what might have caused it," chief police investigator Joergen Andersen told reporters. "It has been a pretty serious accident." The accident took place on a road-and-rail bridge, part of the Storebaelt system of bridges and a tunnel that link the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen. The transport system was closed to cars overnight because of strong winds but trains could pass. Road traffic resumed Wednesday with a 50 kph (31 mph) speed limit. Police spokesman Lars Braemhoej said while "we do not know precisely what caused the accident," one possible cause was that cargo from the freight train fell off and hit the passenger train. He added there was "considerable damage" on the passenger train. "Ordinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed," Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said as he issued his condolences. Denmark's Queen Margrethe said the "terrible accident ... touches me deeply." Police urged passengers to contact relatives and tell them if they were safe and urged people not to share photos or videos of the accident. Flemming Jensen, the CEO of state-owned Danish Railways, said police and the Danish Accident Investigation Board were investigating the damages. He said the operator "will contribute everything that we can to the investigation." Bo Haaning of the Danish Accident Investigation Board was quoted as saying it could take months before the cause of the accident could be determined. In 1988, eight people were killed and 72 injured when a train derailed because of high speed near Soroe, west of Copenhagen. Denmark's worst train accident occurred in 1919, when an express train collided with a stopped train in Copenhagen due to a dispatcher error.

[unused1] [unused2] Dhaka High-Rise Hit By Deadly Blaze Lacked Proper Fire Exits: Official World | Reuters | Updated: March 29, 2019 16:05 IST Dhaka: A high-rise commercial building in the Bangladeshi capital where a blaze this week killed at least 25 people lacked proper fire exits, government officials said, prompting a senior minister to describe the incident as "murder". Lax regulations and poor enforcement have often been blamed for several large fires in the south Asian nation that have led to hundreds of deaths in recent years, at least 96 since last month. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of Thursday's fire, in which at least seven people, including a Sri Lankan, died after jumping off the 22-storey structure in one of the world's most densely congested cities. "There were no proper fire exits in the building that houses many offices and several restaurants," Julfikar Rahman, director of the Fire Service and Civil Defence, told Reuters. "It the building had proper fire exits, people would have been able to come out. There was little fire-fighting equipment in the building and it was not in working condition." At just 0.6 m and 1.2 m wide, the building's two exits were too narrow for people inside to leave smoothly, and were blocked by obstructions that made the task harder, he added. Reuters could not ascertain who owns the building, and a telephone number for the purported owner was switched off. The Dhaka development authority said it was investigating how the owner, who had permission only to build 18 stories, managed to extend them to 22. "It's not an accident, it's murder," Public Works and Housing Minister Rezaul Karim told reporters after visiting the site, where firefighters combed through the ashes. "Legal action will be taken against those responsible for violating the building code, no matter how powerful they are." Helicopters had joined 22 firefighting units in battling the fire, along with police and armed forces, as some of those trapped in the building waved desperately for help from its windows and roof. COMMENT The blaze comes a month after an inferno killed 71 people in an old neighbourhood of the city. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a

[unused1] [unused2] 20 Dead In Surat Coaching Centre Fire, Students Jumped Off Building All India | Edited by Divyanshu Dutta Roy | Updated: May 25, 2019 10:09 IST Surat: At least 20 people, mostly students, were killed after a massive fire broke out at a coaching centre in Gujarat's Surat on Friday afternoon. Videos posted by witnesses on social media showed several students jumping out of windows on the top floor of the four-storey building to escape the blaze. Most of the students are said to be between the ages of 14 and 17. "The fire started near the staircase, so they could not get down," Joint Commissioner of Police Harikrishna Patel said Disturbing visuals showed people on the pavement asking the students to jump off the burning building, hoping to catch them. Among those seen falling was a young child. "Some of these students are critical but the crowd managed to save their lives," Darshana Jardosh, the parliamentarian from Surat, told NDTV. The fire, which broke out at around 3:30 pm, engulfed the top two floors of the commercial building called Takshashila Arcade in the Sarthana area of Surat, officials said. About 50 or 60 people were inside when the fire broke out, covering the area in huge plumes of smoke. The fire was likely caused due to an electrical short circuit, Mr Patel said. A video showed an electrical box of high-voltage cables outside the building on fire. An FIR (First Information Report) has been filed against the owner of the building, the person who conducted the class and the man who constructed the building. They are on the run. Officials told news agency AFP that the fire spread quickly because of the material used in the roof of the building. It did not have a functioning fire escape. A fire official said 19 fire engines were sent in to tackle the fire. "The toll has jumped to 19 and includes 16 females. Sixteen persons died because of burns and three others from injuries after they jumped," Jayesh M Patel, medical officer at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research, told AFP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the incident.

[unused1] [unused2] Army orders fresh probe against Colonel for ‘suicide’ by officer’s wife in unit The Army has ordered a re-investigation into the role of a former Commanding Officer (CO) of a battalion of the Brigade of Guards, in the rank of Colonel, with regards to the alleged suicide committed by the wife of the second in command of the unit deployed in Rajasthan in October 2018. Advertising In a move that has raised eyebrows, the Army has set aside the first Court of Inquiry held into the incident in November 2018 and has ordered a fresh Court of Inquiry with explicit instruction to look into any possible acts of moral turpitude which the CO may have indulged into. The previous inquiry has been set aside on the plea that it did not have proper composition. Documents accessed by The Indian Express reveal that the new Court of Inquiry has been ordered by the Jodhpur-based HQs 12 Corps on January 29, 2018. A Brigadier has been appointed the presiding officer of the inquiry along with two officers of the rank of Colonel and a lady officer of the rank of Major. The lady officer has been detailed because it is felt that during the course of the inquiry ladies may be asked to come and depose before the inquiry. The incident pertains to October 26, 2018 when the wife of a Lt Colonel allegedly committed suicide in Pokhran. The CO of the battalion, who was later removed from command, is alleged to have been in consistent touch with the lady, who was the wife of his immediate subordinate, and hence his role is being examined. As per the orders issued by the Army, the Court of Inquiry shall take the opinion of the medical authorities regarding the cause of the death of the lady. “State of physical and mental health of the lady be also taken on record through competent witnesses such as husband and doctors who may have examined her,” the order reads. It goes to direct that phone call records of the known telephone numbers of the lady may also be obtained and examined to find out whether the former CO had made calls, messages, WhatsApp communication to verify the allegations made against him. The orders also explicitly mention that the inquiry should also take into consideration any other relevant facts or information considered necessary, including acts of moral turpitude, if any, which may come during the Court of Inquiry proceedings with regard to allegations made against the Colonel. Army sources inform that there had been considerable upheaval in the battalion over the death of the officer’s wife and a spate of allegations had been levelled against the then CO. Senior officers of the chain of command had intervened to bring the matters in control and the Colonel had been immediately shifted from the unit pending the first inquiry. It is also learnt that he had been given a clean chit during that inquiry. However, subsequent to a legal opinion tendered by the Judge Advocate General’s branch of Army’s Southern Command, the matter is once again being examined.

[unused1] [unused2] Stir after MTC bus runs over techie in Perambur CHENNAI: A 28-year-old software engineer died at Otteri here on Saturday after falling off his two-wheeler and coming under the wheels of an MTC bus. The deceased has been identified as Ambuj Kathotiya. The accident happened near Stephenson Road and Dr Ambedkar College Road Junction in Perambur when he was going to buy groceries. Kathotiya's two-wheeler skidded when he tried to overtake an MTC bus plying between Periyar Nagar and Broadway (route number 142). Eyewitnesses told police that the motorcycle skidded because of the sludge on the road caused by spilling of mud carried by trucks from a construction site in the area. “This is not the first accident. A 17-year-old girl died at the same spot after a truck ran over her. A 70-year-old man fell off his two-wheeler but he escaped with minor injuries,” said Kathotiya’s neighbour Vikas Kataria. “For the four-five months, they are creating plots and transferring the mud to another site. A lot of black mud was spilling on the road. We cannot ride or walk on the road. During rain, it is very slippery, he said . Soon after the accident, the residents of the North Town Estate staged a road blockade at Otteri. They demanded action against a building construction firm. The sludge caused by construction activities posed danger to the road users, they alleged. The protesters said they had lodged complaints against the construction firm. However, there was no action. Residents also said apart from the spill over mud from trucks , silt from the storm water drains was dumped on the road. "That too might have led to the accident," said a resident. As protest continued, police arrested 50 people, including women, for blocking the road. They were taken to a marriage hall in Pulianthope. Of those booked, Jithesh Mehta, Ashwin C Jain, Rajendra Kumar, Tarun, Maninder and another person were booked under the IPC Sections 143 (unlawful assembly) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and were arrested. After the protest by residents, the Chennai Corporation employed workers to clean the road. Corporation officials locked and sealed the construction site. "We will take further action. Now, we have sealed the site," said an official. Top Comment Road contractor and department responsible should be bought to road and pelted to death.. Saranyan Palanisami The Kilpauk traffic investigation wing police registered a case under the Section 304 (A) (death caused due to negligent driving) of the IPC and arrested the bus driver.

[unused1] [unused2] Five killed in Indonesian plane crash Five people were found dead on Thursday after a small plane crashed in Indonesia’s Papua province a day earlier, the latest in a series of aviation accidents to hit the country. The Pilatus Porter PC-6 aircraft lost contact around mid-day on Wednesday just eight minutes after it took off from Wamena city, located in the eastern province’s mountainous region. It had been flying southwest toward neighbouring Nduga province. The plane wreckage was spotted in a mountainous area nine miles (14km) from Wamena airport late on Wednesday. There were no survivors from the crash. The plane, owned by missionary firm Associated Mission Aviation (AMA), was carrying three passengers and two crew, including the Dutch pilot. The other four victims were Indonesian. Rescue crew began work early on Thursday and all five bodies were recovered from the crash site, officials said. “The main challenge was the plane wreckage lies on a cliff, so the evacuation team used a helicopter and hoisted the bodies up,” Rasburhani, the head of Wamena airport, who uses one name, told AFP. Indonesia relies heavily on air transport to connect its thousands of islands but has a poor aviation safety record and has suffered several fatal crashes in recent years. Papua is a particularly difficult area to reach, and has experienced a number of accidents. In December last year, a military transport plane crashed in Papua, killing 13 people on board.In August 2015, a commercial passenger aircraft operated by Indonesian carrier Trigana also crashed in Papua due to bad weather, killing all 54 people on board.

[unused1] [unused2] Five killed, 40 injured in bus accident while returning from JMM rally in Dhanbad Five people, including three women and an eight-year-old boy, were killed and 40 injured in a bus accident on their way back from a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) rally in Dumka. Their bus, which was hired as part of the rally organisation, was allegedly overloaded and the driver was allegedly half asleep. The bus, moving at a high speed, hit a tree by the road near Kachuwabandh village under Sarath police station, around 270km northeast of capital Ranchi, at the early hours of Sunday. Deoghar deputy commissioner (DC) Rahul Kumar Sinha said that the accident took place around 4am. “Five persons died on the spot, while 16 injured were brought to Sadar and a few other private hospitals in Deoghar,” he said. Police said that the deceased were identified as Badal Hansda, 60, Pabnit Besra, 38, Surajmani Soren, 33, Gulabi Murmu, 27, and her son Sunil Marandi,8. One of the injured, Rakha Murmu, 26, said that more than 70 villagers had boarded the bus, which started from Dumka around 2.45am, heading for Madhupur in Deoghar. “The bus was in full speed and the driver seemed to be dozing, which led to the accident,” Murmu said. She said that they went to participate in the JMM rally, organised to mark the party’s foundation day, at Dumka on Saturday night. JMM, which was founded on February 3, 1973, celebrates its foundation day in Dumka every year. Local people said that since the accident occurred before daybreak, the injured persons remained lying on the road for an hour. As soon as the locals got news of the mishap, they reached the spot along with the police and helped with the rescue. The injured were brought to the Community Health Centre (CHC), and then referred to Deoghar Sadar hospital. People with minor injuries were released after first aid. Deputy commissioner Sinha said, “After post-mortem, the bodies were handed over to family members. The district administration has paid Rs 20,000 to each family for last rites under the social security scheme.” Deoghar civil surgeon Dr Krishna Kumar said that the condition of eight persons among the injured was critical. “Neuron cases would be referred to better hospitals out of the district, if required,” Kumar said. BJP legislator and labour and employment minister Raj Paliwar; JMM leader and former assembly speaker Shasank Sekhar Bhokta; and JMM leader and former minister Haji Hussain Ansari also reached the hospital. Paliwar announced Rs 50,000 ex gratia from the MLA fund to the family of each deceased — all the victims were from his Madhupur assembly constituency. “I would talk to the chief minister for government assistance to the injured people and their better treatment,” the minister said. The BJP legislator held the JMM responsible for the tragic incident. “I don’t want to politicise the tragedy, but the way JMM leaders left the villagers in the lurch after the rally in Dumka late at night was sheer negligence. When women and children were called to participate in the rally, it was the JMM leaders’ duty to ensure their safe return to the villages,” said Paliwar. However, JMM leader Ansari said, “It was merely an accident, which should not be politicised for political gains. The government should ensure better treatment of the injured rather than be involved in mud-slinging.”

[unused1] [unused2] Workers in Kenya capital still trapped after militant attack at upscale hotel complex that killed 15 The attack on the upscale hotel complex at 14 Riverside, by at least four gunmen, began shortly after 3 p.m. on Tuesday with an explosion in the parking lot and then a suicide bomb blast in the foyer of the dusitD2 Hotel, police said. Somali militant group Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility. Grief-stricken Kenyans flocked to a morgue in the capital, Nairobi, on Wednesday to look for loved ones among at least 15 people killed in a militant attack on a hotel complex, as workers still trapped pleaded for help. The attack on the upscale hotel complex at 14 Riverside, by at least four gunmen, began shortly after 3 p.m. on Tuesday with an explosion in the parking lot and then a suicide bomb blast in the foyer of the dusitD2 Hotel, police said. Somali militant group Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility. As dawn broke on Wednesday, gunfire rang out again and went on to erupt sporadically, a first responder told Reuters. “The area around 14 Riverside Drive is a Crime Scene … under an active security operation,” police said in a message on Twitter. Many of the victims had been dining in the Secret Garden restaurant and lay slumped at their tables, photos seen by Reuters showed. Eleven Kenyans, an American and a Briton were among the casualties, morgue staff said. Two victims had not been identified. Blasts and shots had punctuated the night, undercutting assurances from the interior minister late on Tuesday that the scene had been secured, and complicating the rescue of scores of people trapped inside. Some of those trapped got messages out begging for medical help. At least two groups of people remained in the hotel and business complex at nearly 7 a.m., a first responder told Reuters. Families who had gone to the Chiromo morgue seeking loved ones were told they could not view the bodies until a forensic investigation had been performed, provoking grief and anger. One man who only gave his name as David said he had yet to hear from a relative in the hotel complex. “I have been trying to reach him since yesterday when the incident happened … I spoke to him when the incident started around 3.30, when they started shooting … his phone went off around 4 p.m.,” he told Reuters at the morgue. The family of one 35-year-old man collapsed in the courtyard upon hearing a body had arrived with his identification papers. “He is gone, he is gone,” the father repeated into his phone as his mother wrapped a shawl around herself and wept. Another family arrived, demanding to see whether their relative was there but were told only police had access. As they argued, an elderly couple arrived in silence, bringing a freshly pressed suit to dress their son. Outside the morgue, two Red Cross ambulances waited, their drivers asleep inside. They would go to the complex to retrieve casualties once it was safe, morgue staff said.

[unused1] [unused2] Delhi woman who killed her kids booked, police check claim of domestic abuse Police on Tuesday registered a case of murder and attempt to suicide against a 34-year-old woman, a day after she allegedly killed her two minor children by throwing them down from the terrace of a four-storey building in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar. At around 9pm Monday, the woman, who the police identified only by her first name Alia, allegedly first threw her three-year-old son onto the road, and then her seven-year-old daughter onto the rooftop of the adjacent two-storey building. She then followed her daughter by jumping off the terrace. Police said Alia’s husband Munawwar (identified by his first name) was at his automobile spare parts shop in north Delhi’s Sadar Bazar at the time. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that they have requested the Delhi government to constitute a panel of doctors to conduct the autopsies of the children. Police said they are yet to ascertain why Alia killed her children and tried to kill herself. While she is undergoing treatment at Lok Nayak hospital and is unfit for statement, her husband told the police that she was suffering from depression and was undergoing treatment for the past few months. While neighbours told police they have often and that Alia had complained to the police on Saturday over alleged domestic violence, police did not confirm this. “We have not recovered a suicide note,” said DCP Singh. “We have booked the woman under section 302 (murder) and 309 (suicide attempt) of the Indian Penal Code. Her husband told us that his wife was on medication for depression. However, we are yet to get her medical records. The claims of the neighbours regarding the couple’s marital problems and police complaint are also being verified,” said DCP Singh. Alia’s family lived on the third floor. Zafar Abbas, a lawyer who lives with his family in the adjacent flat, said he was speaking to his father over the cellphone and his wife was cooking dinner in the kitchen when they heard a commotion outside. “We looked out from our balcony and heard people screaming that a child had fallen from our building. I checked on my four children and was relieved after seeing them in the house. We then rushed downstairs and found that the child was our neighbour Munawwar’s son,” said Abbas. Just as Abbas was trying to rush the boy to a nearby hospital, neighbours alerted that a woman and a girl were lying injured on the roof of the adjacent building. “We rushed over there and found Alia and her daughter. A woman in our neighbourhood told us that she had seen Alia throwing her children before jumping off the building,” said Fiza Fatima, Abbas’s wife. Munawwar is from Bihar while Alia was born and brought up in Mumbai. The couple were married for around 10 years.

But when videos of the incident went viral on social media, he was the one seen clinging to the windowpanes on the third floor and saving those trapped inside one by one way before the fire brigade managed to get its act together. Ketan, who lives close to the area where the fire broke out, was able to save at least 10 students of a coaching centre located on the top floor of the building. Many people, including a child, were seen jumping from the top two floors of the building, in their desperation to escape the blaze. "There was a lot of smoke. I could not figure out what to do. A girl fell to the ground in front of me while trying to escape the blaze. Seeing this, I quickly arranged a ladder and propped it behind the building and helped as many people get to safety," he told NDTV. Then, he decided to go in and help the others still tapped. In visuals that have played on loop on television channels since then, Ketan is seen sliding out of a window, hanging precariously on third floor and helping students as young as 13, exit the building. rkuc12n8 Ketan Jorawadia was seen in videos helping those caught inside the building in Surat. "When I reached the top, I started bringing down the kids one by one. There were many still caught inside even then," Ketan said. Ketan's bravery has made him a hero not just in Surat but also won the hearts of people online. His lament: if more people tried to help instead of filming the tragedy on their phones, more lives could have been saved. "The fire brigade reached around 40 minutes after the fire broke out. They took some time in parking fire engines. They did not have sufficient equipment. If they were having something like a net, some students could have saved their lives by jumping on it," he added. The Gujarat government has ordered an investigation into the incident. Two fire officers have been suspended for granting a safety clearance to the building. The police have arrested the Bhargav Bhutani, who ran the coaching centre, and have also registered a case against owners of the building - Harshal Vekaria and Jignesh Padgal. 12 COMMENTS Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and many other leaders condoled the incident on Twitter. An investigation has been ordered into the incident and the state government has promised to give Rs. 4 lakh to each of the families of those killed.

[unused1] [unused2] Delhi man drives burning car aside to save others, loses family delhi Updated: Mar 11, 2019 08:12 IST Even as a blaze spread quickly in his car, Upendra Mishra drove it to the side of the flyover before exiting and saving his daughter, said eyewitnesses. Stopping the burning car in the middle of the busy Akshardham flyover could have soon turned into a death trap for other vehicles. “The car’s rear portion had caught fire,” said Babloo Kumar, who works at a tent house close to the accident site. “In the time, he slowly moved towards the footpath to stop the car. More than half of it had been engulfed in the fire. The man jumped out and pulled out his daughter who was sitting next to him in the front. Other commuters passing by tried to unlock or break open the rear door but failed. We feared that the car may explode and maintained a safe distance.” Fire officials said the rear doors may have been locked. Mishra tried repeatedly to break open the rear doors of his car to save his family. “People held him back else he too would have died in the fire. He was crying loud and was screaming for help. However, the heat was so much that none of us could even stand close to the vehicle,” said Karan Sarkar, another witness to the incident. An official at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, where the bodies were taken for autopsy, said, “The bodies were charred beyond recognition, they were burnt right through.” An auto driver who had also stopped by to help the family, said the traffic cops had reached the spot in time and cleared the traffic. “One carriage way on the flyover had to be blocked. The traffic was disrupted. Meanwhile senior police officers also arrived at the spot along with fire tenders and ambulance. The firemen doused the fire.Police cordoned off the area and we were asked to keep away from the spot. Police called a crane which move the gutted vehicle away and traffic was restored,” said Prashant Kashyap, the auto rickshaw driver from Anand Vihar. Police said Mishra owned the car and used to drive it for the online used car selling company. They said since he had planned a family outing on Sunday, he didn’t take the car to work and took the day off to spend with family. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that Mishra, a driver by profession, is in a state of shock. “We will ask him sequence of event to find out reason of fire in the car later,” Singh said.
[unused1] [unused2] Eight dead in two bomb explosions outside Philippines church Police and military reports say at least eight people died, including five troops and three civilians. At least one civilian has been wounded. Two bombs exploded outside a Roman Catholic cathedral on a southern Philippine island where Muslim militants are active, killing at least eight people during a Sunday Mass, officials said. Advertising The first bomb went off in or near the Jolo cathedral in the provincial capital, followed by a second blast outside the compound as government forces were responding to the attack, security officials said. Police and military reports said at least eight people died, including five troops and three civilians. A number of people were reported wounded. Jolo island has long been troubled by the presence of Abu Sayyaf militants, who are blacklisted by the United States and the Philippines as a terrorist organization because of years of bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. No one has immediately claimed responsibility. The attack came nearly a week after minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation endorsed a new autonomous region in the southern Philippines in hopes of ending nearly five decades of a separatist rebellion that has left 150,000 people dead. Although most of the Muslim areas approved it, voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The province is home to a rival rebel faction that’s opposed to the deal as well as the Abu Sayyaf group, which is not part of any peace process. Western governments have welcomed the autonomy pact. They worry that small numbers of Islamic State-linked militants from the Middle East and Southeast Asia could forge an alliance with Filipino insurgents and turn the south into a breeding ground for extremists.

[unused1] [unused2] Battle rages in Mogadishu as hotel attack death toll nears 30 Heavy gunfire rang out across central Mogadishu on Friday as Somali troops battled to dislodge Islamist insurgents holed up next to a hotel they bombed the previous evening, and as the death toll stemming from that attack neared 30. Al Shabaab fighters set off two bombs outside the Hotel Maka Al-Mukarama before retreating to an adjacent building, from where they fired on soldiers who tried to enter. At least two soldiers were carried away from the hotel on Friday morning. The attack - the latest in a series of high-profile assaults in East Africa by al Shabaab - came after U.S. forces in Somalia stepped up air strikes against the Islamist group. “The militants are still fighting from inside a civilian house adjacent to the hotel... [They] are fighting back with grenades and Kalashnikov [rifles],” police officer Major Musa Ali told Reuters. He said 29 people, mostly civilians, had died in the attack and its aftermath, and 80 had been wounded. Many civilians had been rescued but the death toll could rise, he added. Al Shabaab's military spokesman said the group was still in control of the Hotel Maka Al-Mukarama, which is used by government officials and located on a street lined with hotels, shops and restaurants. “The government tried three times to enter the building but we repulsed them,” said Abdiasis Abu Musab. Somalia has been convulsed by lawlessness and violence since 1991, and al Shabaab is fighting to dislodge a Western-backed government protected by African Union-mandated peacekeepers. The group has also carried out deadly attacks in neighbouring countries contributing to the African Union force, including one on a hotel and office complex in Kenya in January that killed 21 people. Under President Donald Trump, Washington has stepped up attacks against the group, and U.S. Africa Command announced six air strikes it says have killed 52 militants since Feb. 23. In Mogadishu, a Reuters photographer saw frantic residents in the city searching for missing relatives through the night, making countless phone calls to find out if anyone had seen their family members. “I have been running to and fro from blast scene to hospitals since yesterday evening in search of my husband and brother ...I have just seen them in hospital, they are in critical condition. My husband lost his stomach and my brother suffered severe wounds to both arms,” Halima Omar, a mother of three children, told Reuters. In northern Somalia, a splinter group of former al Shabaab fighters who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State is also battling the insurgency. At least 25 people have been killed in the fighting between the two sides this week when al Shabaab captured three villages from the faction aligned to Islamic State, a military official from the semi-autonomous region of Puntland told Reuters.

[unused1] [unused2] Banihal car bomb attack solved: PHD scholar among 6 terrorists arrested The Jammu and Kashmir police Monday said it has arrested six terrorists, including a PhD scholar, for launching the abortive suicide car bomb attack on a CRPF convoy on Jammu-Srinagar highway last month. The failed attack was jointly hatched by militant outfits Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) under the command of a Pakistani terrorist, Munna Bihari, Jammu Inspector General of Police M K Sinha told reporters here. The arrested PhD scholar is an active member of Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of banned Jammat-e-Islami (JeI), said Sinha. His interrogation has revealed that JeI student wing is currently engaged in radicalizing youths for "jehad" in a big way, he added. Sinha identified the five arrested terrorists as PhD scholar Hilal Ahmad Mantoo, Waseem alias "Doctor", Umar Shafi, Aqib Shah, all hailing from Shopian and Shahid Wani alias "Watson" of Pulwama. The sixth one, Hizbul suicide bomber Owais Amin was arrested on April 1 from Teethar in Banihal when he was trying to escape after unsuccessfully targeting a CRPF convoy with a car bomb near the Jawahar Tunnel - the gateway to the valley on March 31. Sinha said the National Investigation agency is taking over the case tomorrow for further investigation, though, he added, the Jammu and Kashmir police has completely worked it out. Sinha said two HIzbul modules were involved in fabricating the car bomb. "Two modules of Hizbul Mujahideen, one led by Dr Saifullah of Pulwama and the other led by Rayees Khan alias Imad Khan of Shopian had jointly worked to fabricate the car bomb and to take other steps for the explosion," he added. Sinha identified a Pakistani terrorist Muna Bihari, operating in south Kashmir in collusion with a local JeM militant Shahjahan, as the mastermind behind the fabrication of the car bomb by planting IED inside it. The Jammu IGP, however, ruled out any link between the February 14 Pulwama car bomb attack which left 40 CRPF personnel dead and the Banihal attack. He, however, did not rule out the involvement of Pakistan in Banihal attack, saying "the entire module led by Hizbul chief in the valley, Riyaz Naikoo, and Saifullah were involved in the attack along with JeM Pakistani terrorist Muna Bihari". He added that the identity of the exact person who directed them to carry out the attack was not yet known. Sinha said the Jammu and Kashmir police was yet to identify the owner of the car used in the failed bid. "The chassis number and the engine number of the vehicle used in the attack were tempered with. We have sent the vehicle to FSL and they are trying to retrieve the original numbers," he said. Sinha said the source of the gelatin sticks too is to be ascertained and the NIA may find it out in subsequent probe. PhD scholar Mantoo, who was doing some research on anxiety among the students, was arrested from Central University Bathinda in Punjab, he said. He revealed in his interrogation that Jamiat-e-Talaba is "radicalizing youths in a big way for Jehad", he said. "Youths are taken in Jamait-ul-Talba after careful screening and once inducted, they are given an extremely hard-core religious orientation and made to indulge in various activities including terror operations," the IGP said. Sinha said the radicalisation of youth is a major threat because a radicalised youth can do anything and indulge in any violent act. He said the group that was involved in the fabrication of the IED, procuring gelatin sticks, urea, acids and other material was working under the overall command of the Pakistani terrorist. "Amin along with his friend Omar and Aqib were working as over ground workersof Rayees Khan who became active terrorist of Hizbul Mujahideen in 2018. After the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, all four of them were involved in stone pelting," said Sinha. These terrorists were selected for the explosion because they had a clean slate and were off the police radar with no criminal case registered against them earlier, the IGP said.

[unused1] [unused2] Major fire at commercial hub in Thiruvananthapuram Triggering panic in the State capital, a major fire broke out in the commercial hub in the East Fort region on May 21. The fire was reported from a shop-cum-godown of mattresses, umbrellas, bags and other items on the Power House Road at around 9 a.m. after traders nearby detected black smoke emanating from the building. Shortly, the Kerala Fire Rescue Services deployed five fire tenders to the spot. While they were able to douse the fire on the front side of the building that faced the M.G. Road, bringing the fire under control on its rear side was a daunting task. The narrow roads between the crammed buildings in the area that formed part of the East Fort heritage zone appears to have complicated the ongoing fire fighting efforts. With the police having evacuated residents from the houses in the vicinity, the fire force personnel are currently engaged in preventing the fire from spreading to the other buildings. Kerala Fire and Rescue Services Director (Technical) R. Prasad said that most of the buildings in the East Fort region, including the one that was gutted today, failed to satisfy fire safety norms. While a fire audit had been conducted in the area a year ago, following a fire break out near the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, most commercial establishments were served notices by the district administration. However, almost all erring establishments have failed to rectify the inadequacies, Mr. Prasad told The Hindu. As many as 32 fire tenders, including one deployed from the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, and over 200 fire fighters were involved in the operation. The situation is currently under control. The actual cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained, the senior officer said. Local residents claimed to have seen the employees of the shop burning waste outside the building last evening. Two fire force personnel were injured.

Only two people – driver Nagulmeera and one Zakir Pasha – of the total eight occupants of the auto- rickshaw survived. The Chilkur police identified all the victims as hailing from Chintapally village in Korvi mandal of Mahabubabad district. None from the family of Pasha and Begum survived and the rest of the victims were also related to them. According to the police, both the families had come to Palakeedu mandal here on a pilgrimage to the Jan Pahad shrine. After staying at their relatives’ house at Huzurnagar the previous night, at around 6 a.m. on Friday, they started their return journey in a hired auto-rickshaw to Kodad. Some 20 minutes into the journey, near the FCI godowns on the outskirts of Sitarampur village, the auto-rickshaw driver attempted to overtake a truck. However, a speeding lorry coming in the opposite direction rammed the vehicle, the police said. Soon, all the victims were shifted to the hospital. The truck driver is absconding.

[unused1] [unused2] Lurking danger at Athani junction KOCHI: Fatal accidents and near-miss collisions have become a common sight at Athani Junction in Angamaly due to a dangerous curve and unscientific installation of the traffic signal. The other day, a 28-year-old woman and her six-month-old baby were almost rammed over by a speeding car while they were crossing the road. In January, two youths were killed in an accident on the Athani-Chengamanad road. The two-wheeler they were riding crashed into a wall while trying to avoid a head-on collision with another vehicle. According to local residents, the poor visibility of the traffic signal is the main reason for collisions. "The junction is on a curve. Most vehicles coming from Angamaly, usually in the upper-speed limit, don't see the traffic signal ahead because of this. When they do see the signal eventually, it will be too late to stop," says Cheriachen E L, a local resident. Athani Junction, which is a major intersection, is a point connecting Chengamanad/Manjaly, Angamaly and Aluva. "Most of the commuters are either going to or from the airport. They aren't usually familiar with the road. On passing the traffic signal at the airport Junction, most people don't anticipate another signal just 75 metres away," says Thomas John, a shopkeeper. The battered state of the grills on the divider testifies the frequency and prevalence of accidents in the area. Earlier reports suggested accidents take place in the junction every 30 minutes."We see accidents on a daily basis now. Just because these crashes and collisions are not fatal, the authorities are not taking suitable action," says Cheriachen, a retired FACT employee. Despite the intensity of the situation, officials of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) maintain the junction is neither accident-prone nor are the traffic signals installed unscientifically. "There have been no reports stating the traffic signals have been installed unscientifically. Only if accredited agencies give an insight about this, will we be able to take action," said PK Suresh, project director of NHAI.

[unused1] [unused2] Over 50 people dead in mudslide at mining site in Myanmar More than 50 people are believed to have died in a mudslide at a jade mining site in northern Myanmar, a lawmaker representing the area said on Tuesday. Tin Soe said three bodies have been recovered and 54 people remain missing after the accident Monday night in the Hpakant area of Kachin state. “The rescue process will not be easy as they’re under the mud, not just ordinary soil. It is really difficult to get the bodies back,” he said. The mud flowed down on the workers from a collapsed reservoir made from a disused mining pit to contain materials discarded from the mining process. The landscape in the area is extremely uneven, with mountains of debris and valleys formed from abandoned mines. The mud covered not only the workers but also mining equipment, including bulldozers and backhoes, from the Myanmar Thuya Co. and 9 Dragons Co. Tin Soe said the missing were buried under mud up to 100 feet (30 metres) deep. “There is no machine to pump out the mud,” he said by phone. “It could cost millions of dollars.” Local officials did not answer phone calls seeking comment on the accident. Myanmar’s Information Ministry said on its Facebook page that rescue operations have been carried out since Tuesday morning by local authorities together with social welfare organisations. A similar accident involving the release of a massive amount of mud occurred in March, damaging some equipment but causing no deaths. Local activists said the profitability of jade mining led businesses and the government to neglect enforcing already very weak regulations in the industry. The region is also enmeshed in an armed conflict between the government and ethnic rebels from the Kachin Independence Army. “Many jade mining companies do not follow rules and regulations on where or how to dump waste piles,” Maw Htun Awng, a mining governance researcher, said after an accident last year that killed at least 15. “Then there are no actual mechanisms to watch if these companies are following these rules and that’s why this is part of the cumulative impact.”

[unused1] [unused2] Explosion near chemical factory leaves 22 dead, 22 injured in China A huge explosion outside a chemical plant in China's northern Hebei province on Wednesday killed at least 22 people and left as many others injured, the second major industrial accident in the country in the last four days. The blast occurred outside the Hebei Shenghua Chemical Industry in Zhangjiakou, Qiaodong district around 12:40 am, igniting a fire that engulfed nearby vehicles, the officials were quoted as saying by thepaper.cn, a Shanghai-based website. An industrial safety official, identified only as Wu, said that one of the trucks lined up outside the plant to deliver chemicals had exploded, setting off a chain reaction that engulfed other trucks. Chinese news reports, and images from the scene, indicated that a fiery explosion near the plant had set around 50 vehicles ablaze, including dozens of trucks, and sent a dark plume of smoke into the night sky. The fire has now been contained, and a search operation is underway, authorities said. The injured have been taken to a nearby hospital. Employees at the Shenghua plant said operation has been suspended out of safety concern. Shenghua is affiliated with China Haohua Chemical Group, a subsidiary of State-owned ChemChina, which is ranked 167th among Global Fortune 500 enterprises. Fu Jianhua, the vice-minister of emergency management, has led a team to the site to guide relief work, the report said.

A total of 370 houses have been damaged, with 15 having collapsed. A massive explosion in 2015 traced to improperly stored chemicals killed at least 173 people in Tianjin, about an hour east of Beijing.

[unused1] [unused2] Floods in Indonesia kill dozens, thousands displaced Floods sparked by torrential rains have killed nearly 40 in Indonesia with a dozen more still missing, officials said Monday, marking the latest calamity for a disaster-prone nation. Landslides and floods are common during the monsoon season between October and April, when rains lash the vast Southeast Asian archipelago. On Monday, Indonesia's disaster agency confirmed 29 deaths and said at least 13 more people were missing in Sumatra island's Bengkulu province. A landslide triggered by heavy rain in neighbouring Lampung province on Saturday also killed a family of six. Meanwhile, flooding in and around parts of the capital Jakarta last week killed at least two people, forced more than 2,000 to evacuate their homes and set 14 pet pythons on the loose. In Bogor, a satellite city of Jakarta, residents had to contend with the prospect of coming face to face with the giant serpents, after they were set loose from a private property due to the high waters. Six of the snakes -- which were as long as four metres (13 feet) -- have been found, but eight were still missing, officials said at the weekend. "If you find them please report it to authorities or volunteers," said Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. That was not much comfort for some Bogor residents. "We're terrified to hear this," said Samsudin, who goes by one name. "Apparently they're very big so we want authorities to help us find them or take action." In Sumatra, some 12,000 residents have been evacuated from water-logged Bengkulu with hundreds of buildings, bridges and roads damaged. Authorities have set up temporary shelters and public kitchens for those displaced by the rains. Hardest hit was Bengkulu Tengah district, just outside of the provincial capital, where 22 people were killed along with hundreds of livestock. Illegal coal mining was partly to blame for deadly landslides, authorities said. "Apart from natural factors like the heavy rain, (the flooding) was also caused by human activity that destroys the environment," disaster agency head Doni Monardo told reporters in Bengkulu on Monday. Activists have long warned deforestation from rampant mining in the province could trigger a catastrophe. At least four major rivers in Bengkulu overflow every time it rains due to environmental damage near their banks, activists said. "The flooding in Bengkulu was made worse by the severe damage... caused by coal mining," Ali Akbar from local environmental group Kanopi Bengkulu said in a statement. Illegal mining was blamed for killing dozens on the island of Sulawesi in March when a makeshift mine collapsed. Mineral-rich Indonesia has scores of unlicensed mines -- many with complete disregard for even the most basic safety procedures. Also in this year, some by floods and landslides that wiped entire villages off the map. Nearly 10,000 people were displaced. Last month, some 112 people died and more than 90 remain missing after torrential rains pounded Indonesia's Papua region, triggering landslides and flash floods. Indonesia, a nation of some 17,000 islands, is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are a common occurrence.

The impact badly damaged the front of the train, which was lifted off the tracks. Rail travel between Flensburg and Hamburg is expected to be severely disrupted for most of Wednesday, police said, because of damage to overhead lines and the tracks. "A special train from (national rail operator) Deutsche Bahn is coming to get the train that crashed back on the rails," a police spokesman told daily Bild. "But the track where the accident happened will remain closed for hours because the rail bed has been affected."

According to preliminary reports, rescue operations are ongoing with people trapped in both buildings. Four others have been rescued from under the debris. The rescue operations are being overseen by personnel from Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services, State Disaster Response Force, National Disaster Response Force and Karnataka Civil Defence teams. According to G.M. Ravindra, Joint Commissioner of East zone, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the under construction building collapsed first, which caused the four-year-old apartment adjacent to it to also collapse at the street level. He said the building housed 8 apartments and all the 40 residents were evacuated immediately. "However, we have been told that the apartment watchman and his family lived in the basement. The building seems to have collapsed on them. We are not able to access them. The rescue teams are trying to assess how they can be rescued, if they are alive."

[unused1] [unused2] 3 women, 1 man killed at apartment complex where shots fired Three women and a man were found dead at an apartment complex in Ohio where multiple gunshots were fired, police said Monday. No suspect has been identified. A man called 911 around 10 pm Sunday, saying he had arrived at the complex in a northern Cincinnati suburb to find four members of his family wounded, according to West Chester Township police. "They are on the ground and bleeding," said the caller, often choking up and out of breath as the dispatcher struggled to get details from him. "They are all bleeding." At times, he can be heard on the 911 audio frantically yelling "Help!" apparently to neighbours at the Lakefront at West Chester complex. Township Police Chief Joel Herzog said at a news conference Monday that it's too early in the investigation to suggest a motive. It will be up to the Butler County coroner to determine the cause of death and release the victims' identities, Herzog said. Herzog said that it didn't appear that anyone had shot back at the perpetrator or perpetrators, whom police were still working to identify. They were also interviewing family members and neighbours. "It does not appear that the shooter is among the dead," Herzog said, adding that he doesn't believe there is any danger to the community.There was no lockdown in effect at a nearby school, he said. "It appears to be isolated," Herzog said. He added that the victims all appeared to have lived in the same apartment in the township, which is a growing, mostly suburban area roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Cincinnati. The man who called 911 provided little information on the call about what appeared to have happened. The caller has spoken to investigators, Herzog said. He confirmed that the caller was a relative of the victims. Police said it appeared the family was preparing dinner when attacked, and there was some smoke when they arrived from the abandoned meal preparation. Authorities have said that multiple agencies, including the State Highway Patrol, have been assisting in the investigation. Police established a perimeter around the apartment complex early Monday and used police helicopters and K-9 units to search for a suspect.

[unused1] [unused2] Two Delhi Fire Service officials injured as fire breaks out in 3 chemical factories A major fire broke out in three chemical factories in west Delhi's Naraina Monday, triggering a blast in which a fireman and a special officer of the Delhi Fire Service were injured, a senior officer said. The fire broke out in the factories located behind PVR Cinema at the Naraina industrial area around 11.35 am. Forty fire tenders were rushed to the spot after a call about the blaze was received. Officials said the factory where the fire started did not have a fire safety clearance and even the other two factories were functioning without a fire No Objection Certificate. They said there could have been casualties, had it been a working day. "The chemical was adhesive in nature. It is suspected that it was spirit. The fire was brought under control at 2.10 pm. Just when it was thought that the fire had been doused, there was a blast in containers in which chemical was stored which led to injuries to fireman Naresh Kumar and special officer Aman," the Delhi Fire Service official said. The impact of the blast was such that the duo slipped and sustained burn injuries. "The fireman sustained burn injuries on the back and even when water was being poured to ease the pain, he was feeling a burning sensation and was crying constantly," a witness said. The injured were rushed to B L Kapoor Super Specialty Hospital and are out of danger, Chief Fire Officer of Delhi Fire Service Atul Garg said. Garg said it seems the factories did not have fire clearance, but they are checking the facts. One of the three factories was completely gutted in the blaze, one was partially burnt and the third one was affected a little bit, a senior fire officer said, adding that the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. "There was panic in the area as locals saw smoke emanating from a factory around 11 am. Rumours are being spread about the fire tenders reaching late. Actually, fire engines reached there on time," General Secretary of Naraina Gurdwara C S Bhatia said. The blaze intensified due to wind making the job of firemen difficult, an official said, adding that the factory was located in an open area due to which the firetenders could reach the spot in time and had easy access to the factories. Smoke billowing from the factory could be seen from a distance as the firetenders made multiple trips to the fire station to fill water in the containers.

[unused1] [unused2] UN calls for Libya ceasefire as death toll climbs to 1,000 The UN Security Council called on Friday for a ceasefire in Libya as the death toll from a three-month offensive on Tripoli reached 1,000, including scores killed in an air strike that hit a detention centre for migrants. The council condemned the late Tuesday attack on the Tajoura detention camp east of Tripoli and "stressed the need for all parties to urgently de-escalate the situation and to commit to a ceasefire", said a joint statement. Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces hold eastern Libya and much of the country's south, launched an offensive in early April to wrestle the capital from forces loyal to the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). Air strikes and ground fighting have since left nearly 1,000 people dead and some 5,000 wounded, the UN's World Health Organization said. The fighting has forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes and threatens to plunge Libya into deeper conflict. Among the dead are 53 migrants killed Tuesday night in an air raid on a detention centre in the Tripoli suburb of Tajoura, held by the GNA, which accused Haftar's forces of carrying out the strike. A Geneva-based spokesman for the International Organization for Migration said six children were among the migrants killed. Joel Millman said that 350 migrants, including 20 women and four children, were still detained at the centre, one of five air hangars hit in the raid. World powers have been divided over how to respond to Haftar's offensive, with the United States and Russia refusing to condemn the Libyan strongman. The British-drafted council statement condemned the attack on the migrant camp, called for a return to political talks and for full respect of the arms embargo on Libya. It followed a closed-door council meeting on Wednesday during which US diplomats said they needed more time to consult with Washington on the proposed text. The United Nations has called for an independent investigation to determine who was responsible for the strike on the centre, which housed some 600 migrants, mainly from African countries. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey -- which backs the GNA -- called for an end to "unlawful attacks" by Haftar's forces during a meeting with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in Istanbul on Friday, the Turkish presidency said. UN shared coordinates UN agencies and humanitarian groups have repeatedly voiced concern over the plight of thousands of migrants and refugees held in detention centres near combat zones in the capital. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed outrage over the attack and said the United Nations had shared the coordinates of the detention centre with the warring sides to protect the civilians. The carnage in Tajoura was "a tragedy that should have never happened", said Charlie Yaxley, spokesman for the UN's refugee agency. Libya has become a major conduit for migrants seeking to reach Europe and remains prey to numerous militias vying for control of the country's oil wealth. Rights groups say migrants face horrifying abuses in Libya, and their plight has worsened since Haftar launched the offensive against Tripoli. According to the UN, some 5,700 refugees and migrants are being held in detention centres in Libya, 3,300 of whom are vulnerable to fighting in and around Tripoli. Plane downed An initial lightning assault in early April saw Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army steam towards the capital. But they have since been bogged down on its southern outskirts, where frontlines have been frozen for months. GNA forces launched a surprise counter-attack late last month, seizing the strategic town of Gharyan, the main supply base for Haftar's offensive. After the setback, Haftar's forces threatened to intensify strikes against their rivals. Both sides have launched daily air raids throughout the fighting and each lost several planes.

[unused1] [unused2] Eight dead as severe Cyclone Fani hits Puri The extremely severe cyclonic storm Fani barrelled into the Odisha coast on Friday morning, unleashing torrential rain and winds gusting up to 175 kmph, killing at least eight people, bringing rail and air transport to a halt, and swamping towns and villages, officials said. The cyclonic system made landfall at 8 a.m. near the coastal pilgrim town of Puri and brought heavy winds and rainfall to the State capital Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. While the system weakened to a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’, it is expected to cause significant damage as it moves north-northeast through coastal Odisha and West Bengal towards Bangladesh. The system lay centred about 20 km west of Balasore and 200 km west-south west of Kolkata around 8.30 p.m. on Friday, with wind speeds of 110-120 km per hour, gusting at 135 km per hour. More than one million people in low-lying areas were evacuated to nearly 4,000 shelters, ahead of the cyclone’s landfall. Odisha authorities said Fani caused extensive damage to thatched houses as well as several temporary structures. “160 people have been injured and admitted to hospital for treatment. The Special Circuit House, Puri, the Office and Residence of the SP and the Collector have been badly damaged along with many other buildings,” said a note from the State Emergency Operation Centre, Bhubaneswar. Electricity was disrupted in several places and many trees were uprooted, leading to damaged roads and communication networks. The roof of the hostel building at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, was blown away. With aviation equipment at Bhubaneswar’s Biju Patnaik International Airport significantly damaged, flight operations remained suspended on Friday, while Paradip and Gopalpur ports were also closed as a precautionary measure. Around 220 trains on the Howrah-Chennai route have been cancelled, an East Coast Railway official said. Re-curving cyclone Cyclone Fani was a ‘re-curving cyclone’ and therefore a harder to precisely predict than most cyclones. Recurving cyclones' are those that sharply turn north-eastwards instead of a more typical parth of north-westwards. In the Indian context, they are relatively rare and harder to track. It also had an unusually long gestation period of atleast 10 days. The trajectory of the cyclone largely conformed to the IMD’s estimates that it would make landfall by Friday noon and bring heavy rains to Orissa, West Bengal and parts of coastal Andhra Pradesh. Fani was the strongest cyclone to have passed India since cyclone Hudhud in 2014. It’s also the first time since 1976 that a cyclone of such intensity will be blowing through India in April, IMD records show. While severe cyclones (defined as generating maximum windspeeds of 89-117 kmph) can form any time, they tend to be concentrated in November — after the monsoon — or around May, when the monsoon prepares to arrive in Kerala in June. The IMD ranks cyclones on a 5-point scale with the mildest at 62-88 kmph and the strongest, a ‘super cyclonic storm’, at 221 kmph) Odisha pulls out all stops to restore normalcy after Fani fury Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who reviewed the situation in following the landfall of severe cyclonic storm Fani, said Puri district, particularly the holy town had suffered huge damage. “Energy infrastructure has been completely destroyed. Restoration of electricity is a challenging task,” he said. Hundreds of engineers and technicians worked on a war-footing to restore power supply. Work is on to restore road communication, thrown into disarray with thousands of uprooted trees blocking the way in innumerable places, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said. He said since the cyclone was still passing through Odisha, it will take time to make an assessment of the damage. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) DIG Randeep Rana said not many casualties were reported so far as precautionary measures were in place. The Chief Minister said nearly 12 lakh people were evacuated and shifted to safer locations within 24 hours ahead of the cyclone from about 10,000 villages and 52 urban agglomerations in probably the largest such exercise at the time of a natural calamity in the country. The evacuees have been accommodated in over 4,000 shelters, including 880 specially designed cyclone centres where free cooked food is being served to them, he said. After the landfall, the system is expected to sweep north-northeast through coastal Odisha towns of Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur, Bhadrak and Balasore before entering West Bengal, Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) B P Sethi said. Threat to Bengal Meanwhile, West Bengal braced for the remnants of the severe cyclone with precautionary measures for districts like East and West Midnapore, both North and South 24 Parganas besides, Howrah, Hooghly, Jhargram and Kolkata and Sundarbans. The sky was overcast in Kolkata and several other places since Friday morning as rain came in spurts, inundating several parts of the state capital. Traffic snarls were reported from different places in the city. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee cancelled all election rallies over the next 48 hours and is monitoring the situation. “The eye of the storm is likely to be weakened when it enters West Bengal. The wind speed will be around 100 kmph to 110 kmph,” an official of the meteorological department said. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced that said no flights will depart or arrive at Kolkata airport from 3 p.m. on Friday till 8 a.m. on Saturday. A red alert has been issued in coastal areas and fishermen have been asked not to venture into the sea.

[unused1] [unused2] Elderly couple, caretaker murdered in Vasant Vihar An elderly couple and their caretaker were found murdered in their flat in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar on Sunday morning. The bodies of Vishnu Mathur, 78, his wife Shashi, 75, and their caretaker Khushboo, 22, were found in their two-bedroom flat on the first floor of Vasant Apartments. Police said the couple had one stab wound each on their throats while Khusboo had at least five similar wounds around her neck. The entry to the flat was friendly and the assailants deliberately ransacked the house to make it look like robbery, the police said. DCP (South West) Devender Arya said Khusboo, hired through a placement agency, had been staying with the couple for the past six months as a nursing attendant. Police suspect that someone known to her is involved. Mr. Arya said they were informed about the incident at 8.50 a.m. by a neighbour. Babli, a domestic help who had come for household work at the flat, found the door open. On entering the flat, she found Khusboo lying on the floor in a pool of blood and the couple lying dead on a bed. She immediately alerted a neighbour. “We have questioned several people who were frequent visitors to the flat. The case will be worked out soon,” Mr. Arya said. The police said the couple is survived by a married daughter who lives in East of Kailash. She used to visit her parents regularly and talk to them daily through video calls. “We spoke to the couple’s daughter and her husband to know if any jewellery, cash or valuables were missing from the house. They claimed that the couple did not keep any such valuables with them,” said the officer. Vishnu had retired from the office of the Central Government Health Scheme and Shashi from a civic body in New Delhi. They had been living in Vasant Apartments for the past nearly 18 years. The couple had lost their son in a road accident in 1999. “Shashi was bedridden for the past few months as she had fractured her knee and underwent surgery. Khushboo was hired to take care of the couple as Vishnu had also stopped moving out of the flat due to ill health,” a police officer said.

[unused1] [unused2] Double-decker bus rams into overhead pole; no one hurt A double-decker bus rammed into an overhead pole at Vakola in Santacruz (East) in the early hours of Thursday. There were no injuries. According to a Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) spokesperson, the accident occurred at 1.05 a.m. on the service road on Vakola Bridge. “The bus crashed into the overhead gantry bar at the start of Vakola Bridge damaging the upper deck including three seats. There were no injuries.” This is the second instance of a double-decker bus dashing against a barrier in the same area. A similar incident had occurred last July. BEST officials said the bus was not in service on Wednesday as it was under maintenance. The bus only had mechanic Dattatray Sawant and driver Anand Vibhute. “The route taken by the bus was not among the standard routes taken by double-decker buses. Prima facie, it looks like a case of negligence on part of the driver. A departmental inquiry into the incident has been initiated,” a BEST official said. Officials said the bus was travelling at such an odd hour as it was being taken to depot as part of its maintenance and it had not been in operation for a couple of days. The number of double-decker buses has been reducing over the years and there are merely 120 left in the BEST’s fleet.

On Saturday, the family received the bodies after the completion of the postmortem formalities at Ambedkar Hospital. Zainab, who was with her father, was unable to recognise her mother and sister, due to the extent of the injuries they suffered. Speaking to TNIE, Zainab’s father Tabrej Khan, a driver by profession said, “Doctors who treated my daughter Zainab in a private hospital, told me that she needs a minimum of three months to recover from the trauma of the incident. She has injuries on her chest and mouth from the blast.” Recalling the accident, he said that the cylinder shot up into the air like a rocket before descending at high velocity and hitting the family. “I was about to reach the spot where they were standing as I had gone to park my car nearby. It all happened within a few seconds and I was shocked to see my wife and daughter lying in a pool of blood. I collapsed instantly. No one came to help them even while I was screaming continuously,” Tabrej said. Talking about how the family happened to be at the spot, Tabrej said that the kids had insisted that they spend the weekend at their aunt’s house. “Ayera and Zainab came home after school and forced my wife to take them to their aunt’s house in Soolibele. Their aunt Nasareen was waiting to have lunch with them. Ayera was very bright in school and Zainab is a very jovial girl. Now she is not responding to anyone and I am very worried about her,” said her father.

[unused1] [unused2] 38 killed as floods worsen in Mozambique after second cyclone Heavy rain battered northern Mozambique on Monday as residents and relief workers confronted the widespread devastation wrought by Cyclone Kenneth, the strongest cyclone to ever hit Africa, which killed 38 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Roads have been washed away, fields submerged and many buildings wrecked by the storm, which came weeks after Cyclone Idai hit the Mozambican city of Beira, 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) to the south. Cyclone Kenneth made landfall late on Thursday in Cabo Delgado province, packing wind gusts of up to 220 kilometres per hour. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) described it as the strongest cyclone to ever lash the continent, and predicted further heavy rain over the coming days. "Cyclone Kenneth made landfall at the end of the rainy season, when river levels were already high, increasing the risk of river flooding," the UN agency said in its latest update. "Humanitarian needs in Mozambique have sky-rocketed, and the humanitarian response will need to rapidly scale-up." According to figures provided by the Mozambique authorities to NGOs, around 200,000 people in Pemba city, the capital of Cabo Delgado, are in danger. According to a preliminary toll from the National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC), 38 people have died, 39 have been injured, more than 23,000 people are without shelter and nearly 35,000 homes have been either partly or completely destroyed. "The water came inside the house and all the way to the backyard," said Sumala Cabila, 23, standing in his family home in Pemba's working-class Piquite suburb which flooded on Sunday morning. As rain poured down and roads in the district became unpassable except for 4-wheel-drive vehicles, Cabila's sister struggled to look after her one-month-old child. "If it continues to rain. we don't know what we'll do," he said as water streamed of his slanted roof. In Pemba, a tourist destination, staff mopped up pools of water at a hotel and cleared tree branches out of the lobby fountain, while labourers struggled to clear out the city's drainage system blocked by flood debris. "(We) planned to mobilise as much aid as possible to Ibo and also from there to Quissanga via Roa," said UN OCHA official Saviano Abreu, naming two areas outside Pemba worst hit by storm damage and flooding. "It was the priority for government and humanitarian organisations, as these two areas are in urgent need. "We managed to send one flight with World Food Programme (WFP) supplies of rice and biscuits, and some non-food items. But unfortunately the weather conditions are changing too fast and threatening the operation. It's raining again and the second flight couldn't go." To the north of Pemba, the town of Macomia was also badly hit, with homes and businesses destroyed, roofs torn off, trees and electric pylons uprooted. "We have grave fears for the thousands of families currently taking shelter under the wreckage of their homes. They urgently need food, water and shelter to survive the coming days," said Nicholas Finney, head of Save the Children's response team in Mozambique. The northern region hit by Cyclone Kenneth is more sparsely populated than Beira, which was hit by Cyclone Idai in mid-March. But the area has also been hard hit by deadly raids by a jihadist group over the past 18 months that the army has been unable to control. Before smashing into Mozambique, Kenneth passed by the Comoros islands.

[unused1] [unused2] Chinese man gets death for killing wife, hiding body in freezer for over 100 days A court in China’s Shanghai on Friday upheld the death sentence given to a man for killing his wife and hiding her body in a deep freezer for over 100 days. Zhu Xiaodong (30), spent nearly 150,000 yuan ($21,800) from his wife Yang Liping’s credit card on travelling with another woman for “trying to forget about the killing”, state-run China Daily reported. Yang (30), was the only child of her parents. Zhu appealed against the death sentence handed down by the Shanghai No 2 Intermediate People’s Court in August. The Shanghai Higher People’s court on Friday confirmed the sentence, the report said. He was convicted for strangling Yang during an argument on October 17, 2016, at their home in Hongkou district 10 months after they tied the knot, the court said. Zhu, a clerk at a clothing store, hid the body of the woman, a former primary school teacher, in a freezer in the balcony for 106 days, the report said. During the period, he logged into the social networking accounts of his wife and replied to text messages she received from her parents and friends, according to the court. Zhu surrendered before police accompanied by his parents on February 1 after realising he could no longer hide the truth as the couple was asked to attend the father-in-law’s birthday dinner that evening, the report said. He purchased the freezer, which was used to preserve his wife’s body, online on September 22. He claimed that he bought it to store meat for his pet snakes, lizards and frogs. But Yang’s family believed it was a premeditated murder. After Yang’s death, Zhu travelled to Hainan province, Nanjing and Xuzhou cities in Jiangsu province and South Korea in a bid to “trying to forget about the killing“. He used her credit cards for luxury goods and daily expenses. He used Yang’s ID card to check into hotel rooms along with another woman.
