[unused1] [unused2] Record Breaking Colorado Wildfires A large wildfire which broke out on Tuesday the 11th June has destroyed over 300 homes and left two people dead in the Springs area of Colorado in the US. The fire named the Black Forest Fire has been declared the most destructive fire in the State’s history. Since its outbreak along Colorado’s Front Range it has quickly spread by high winds and record heat to burn 12 square miles of land. As the fires continue to burn uncontrollably it has forced an evacuation of 7,000 people. Unfortunately, not everyone fled in time with 2 deaths already confirmed from a burnt out car in the area. It is feared that the death toll may rise in the coming days. Another fire has also hit 60 miles southwest of the Black Forest Fire near Royal Gorge Bridge Park, which has burnt 6 square miles of land and is still yet to be controlled. This fire has caused 900 inmates from Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility to be evacuated because of the heavy smoke in the area. In total 3 structures have been destroyed near Canon City but no deaths have been reported. All fires have unknown causes at this time. However, another fire which was detected on Monday in the Rocky Mountains was confirmed to be from a lightning strike. The fire caused 300 acres of land to burn but no structures were threatened. At this current time wildfires are also burning in California and New Mexico with many of them being caused by lightning strikes. Sadly a fire-fighter lost his life fighting forest fires in California, his death is believed to be caused by a falling tree.

[unused1] [unused2] Blast near foreign contractor’s car in Kabul, 4 injured. Kabul, March 2. An explosion near a vehicle belonging to foreign workers left at least four people injured on Friday in eastern Kabul, an area where many expatriates reside, the Afghan interior ministry said. It was not immediately clear if the explosion was a bomb. The blast hit “an international contractor company’s car”, interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish told AFP, adding that the four wounded were all civilians. Local media showed images of damage to houses and shops in the area. If confirmed as an attack, it would be the latest to hit Kabul, which is one of the deadliest places in Afghanistan for civilians as both the Taliban and the expanding Islamic State group step up their assaults on the city. The explosion also comes just days after Afghan president Ashraf Ghani unveiled a plan for peace talks with the Taliban, including a proposal to eventually recognise them as a political party. Ghani revealed his plans in a speech during international peace talks in Kabul this week that went better than expected, with officials in Washington daring to hold out hope that the longest war in its history may be heading to a negotiated settlement. But Kabul remains on high alert, fearing further violence. Since mid-January, militants have stormed a luxury hotel, bombed a crowded street, raided a military compound and launched a suicide attack during morning rush hour in the capital, killing more than 130 people. — AFP

[unused1] [unused2] Portugal forest fire: At least 24 killed, most of them burned in their cars A huge forest fire in central Portugal killed at least 24 people and injured 20 others, most of them burning to death in their cars, the government said. Around 500 firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched to tackle the blaze, which broke out on Saturday afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande before spreading. “What we are seeing is a great tragedy. For the moment, 24 deaths are confirmed, but the number of fatalities could still rise,” Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon. “The priority now is to get the ongoing fire under control -- after that we must understand what happened,” he said. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians. “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera,” Gomes told journalists. Fourteen civilians were injured, 10 of them seriously, along with six firefighters, he added. The flames spread “with great violence”, moving out on four fronts, he said. Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused. President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims, “sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people,” he said. Firefighters did “all they could” when faced with the blaze, he added. Portugal was sweltering under a severe heatwave Saturday, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in several regions. The country was hit by a series of fires last year which devastated more than 1,000 square km of the mainland. Fires on the tourist island of Madeira in August killed three people, while over the course of 2016 around 40 homes were destroyed and 5,400 hectares of land burned.
[unused1] [unused2] 10 killed in Germany train collision Ten persons were killed and more than 100 were injured when two passenger trains collided head-on near a Bavarian spa town about 60km southeast of Munich today, German police said.

[unused1] [unused2] Six killed in Lahore bombing A Taliban suicide bomber today killed six persons and himself in a brazen attack on police headquarters in Lahore. According to the militants, the attack was a revenge bid for the recent hangings of colleagues. It was the third in a series of high-profile attacks in the last month triggered by a government decision in December to begin hanging those convicted of terror attacks, reversing an informal six-year moratorium on the death penalty. "We claim the attack in Lahore because the government is killing our men in prison," said Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman for powerful Taliban splinter group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. "We will get revenge for every man and our struggle will continue until sharia is instituted in the country," he said, referring to Islamic law. Punjab police chief Mushtaq Sukhera said a policeman and four civilians were among the dead. Jam Hussain, a spokesman for the emergency services, said six bodies had been recovered along with the attacker's. At least 23 people were injured, said Khawaja Salman Rafique, health adviser to the chief minister of Punjab. Casualties would have been much greater if the police had not been alert and kept out the bomber, Lahore police chief Amin Wains told reporters at the attack site. "It was a suicide blast, the bomber blew up prematurely outside the police offices," he added. "That he could not enter the offices shows our security was successful." Ali Raza, the owner of a shop nearby, said the blast had been powerful enough to knock over one of his employees, and left body parts strewn in the street. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to hold peace talks with the Taliban after he came to power in elections in 2012. But the talks failed, and last June, the military launched an offensive to drive the Taliban from their stronghold. Several militant attacks followed, culminating in a December Taliban massacre at a school in Peshawar that killed 134 children and 19 adults.

The injured man was in stable condition. Police didn't fire any shots, Johnson said. A SWAT team searched the rest of the building and no other victims were found. The gunman's motive had not yet been determined, but authorities emphasised it was not a case of an active shooter targeting as many people as possible. "This incident was workplace violence," Johnson said. Video showed people running from a two-story office building shouting about a shooting inside. The building in a well-to-do neighborhood in Long Beach is home to three law firms, but police did not reveal the office where the shooting occurred. The site is about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles in Long Beach, a city of about 460,000 people.

[unused1] [unused2] Russia hunts for body parts, clues after plane crash that killed 71 Emergency workers in Russia searched snow-covered fields outside Moscow on Monday, looking for body parts and clues after a fatal plane crash a day earlier killed all 71 people on board. President Vladimir Putin has ordered a special commission to investigate what caused the AN-148 plane operated by Saratov Airlines to crash outside Moscow shortly after taking off for the city of Orsk in the Orenburg region, about 1,500 kilometres southeast of the capital. Among the possible causes investigators are looking into are weather conditions, human error and the plane’s technical condition. The plane’s crew did not send any distress signals. Experts are analysing a flight recorder recovered in the wreckage as well as plane fragments. Footage from a CCTV camera which captured some of what happened was posted online on Monday. It showed what looked like a large ball of fire streaking through the sky. Debris and human remains are spread over a radius of a kilometre around the crash site, investigators have said. Officials from Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry told a meeting broadcast on state TV on Monday that DNA tests were being organised with the relatives of those killed to try to identify body fragments. The plane, manufactured in 2010, had been carrying 65 passengers and six crew. The passenger list showed many young people were on board, including a five-year-old girl.

[unused1] [unused2] 6.0 earthquake strikes off coast of Ecuador A magnitude 6.0 earthquake has struck off the coast of Ecuador in the same area where a deadly tremor left hundreds dead last year. President Lenin Moreno said there were no immediate reports of victims or major damages from the quake, which struck shortly after 6 am (1100 GMT) and was felt in 12 provinces across the country. The US Geological Survey said the quake, with a depth of 25 kilometers, was centered around the town of San Vicente. More than 600 people were killed and thousands more injured when a 7.8 magnitude quake struck along Ecuadors Pacific coast in April 2016. Authorities said that there wasn’t a risk of a tsunami and appealed for calm.
[unused1] [unused2] Cyclone Gita hits New Zealand; emergency declared in southern city New Zealand’s national carrier on Tuesday cancelled all flights in and out of the capital, Wellington, and the southern city of Christchurch declared a state of emergency as the remnants of tropical cyclone Gita pummelled the country. Even before the storm hit in full force, heavy rains in the centre of New Zealand brought floods in Christchurch, prompting a warning from Mayor Lianne Dalziel. “The full impact of the storm will be felt overnight and tomorrow morning,” she said, urging residents of low-lying areas to evacuate. “We are expecting homes to be flooded.” Air New Zealand said all flights to the capital would be grounded from 2.45 p.m. (0145 GMT) as weather authorities issued warnings of severe weather and heavy rain and gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph). Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said troops had fanned out to areas likely to be the hardest hit and the national Civil Defence office in Wellington was on standby to help. “My message still to people is please look out for your local warnings and expect disruption to travel and please just be careful,” she told reporters at parliament. Cyclone Gita hit the Pacific island nations of Fiji and Tonga last week, packing winds up to 275 kph (171 mph). Fiji escaped major damage but Tonga suffered widespread destruction and flooding. Earlier, the storm had caused extensive damage in Samoa and American Samoa. The cyclone had since been downgraded to a storm, but forecasters said it was still likely to wreak havoc on Tuesday evening as it traversed the centre of New Zealand. Parts of the country are still reeling from a huge storm that prompted authorities to declare states of emergency at the beginning of February. More than 40 schools and preschools shut in the upper South Island, while mayors urged people to stay home. Transport authorities shut a stretch of highway along the east coast of the South Island and the Department of Conservation was closing seaside hiking tracks and campsites along the West Coast and ushering tourists away from low-lying areas, media said.

[unused1] [unused2] Pilger tornadoes. On 16th June 2014 a storm cloud produced 4 tornadoes, of which two were rare twin tornadoes a mile apart from each other. Although multiple tornadoes do occur, what made these rare was the fact that there was no dominant tornado and they were both strong EF4 tornadoes with winds of 200 mph. The tornadoes touched down in the small town of Pilger causing devastation. 2 people including a child and an elderly man were killed and 19 were left injured of which 16 were in critical condition. 75% of the building in Pilger destroyed or damaged.

[unused1] [unused2] Nearly 200 dead in Syria air strikes as UN warns situation ‘out of control’ Air strikes hit Syria’s Eastern Ghouta for a third straight day on Tuesday, bringing the civilian death toll to nearly 200 as the UN warned the situation in the rebel enclave was spinning “out of control”. Air strikes and rocket and artillery fire have battered the rebel-held enclave since Sunday in apparent preparation for a government ground assault on the besieged region. At least 194 civilians have been killed, among them 57 children, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. On Monday alone, 127 civilians, including 39 children, were killed in the bombardment -- the single bloodiest day for Eastern Ghouta in four years. Fresh air strikes on Tuesday morning killed at least 50 civilians, including 13 children, the Britain-based war monitor said. Held by rebels since 2012, Eastern Ghouta is the last opposition pocket around Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad is keen to retake it with an apparently imminent ground assault. The UN’s regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria Panos Moumtzis has warned that the targeting of civilians in the enclave “must stop now”. “The humanitarian situation of civilians in East Ghouta is spiralling out of control. It’s imperative to end this senseless human suffering now,” Moumtzis said on Monday. The UN has repeatedly called for a month-long ceasefire across Syria’s front lines, from Eastern Ghouta to the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in the northwest, which Turkey threatened on Tuesday to lay siege to in the coming days. ‘No words’ “February 19 was the one of the worst days that we’ve ever had in the history of this crisis,” said an exhausted doctor in a hospital in Eastern Ghouta. Identifying himself as Abu al-Yasar, he described treating a one-year-old brought into the Arbin hospital with blue skin and a faint pulse, rescued from under the rubble. “I opened his mouth to put in a breathing tube and I found it packed with dirt,” Abu al-Yaar told AFP. He pulled out the dirt as fast as possible, put in the breathing tube and managed to save the baby’s life. “This is just one story from among hundreds of wounded.” The bloodshed prompted the UN children’s agency UNICEF to issue a largely blank statement on Tuesday to express its anger. “We no longer have the words to describe children’s suffering and our outrage,” the agency said in a brief postscript beneath the empty space on the page. “Do those inflicting the suffering still have words to justify their barbaric acts?” More than 400,000 people live in Eastern Ghouta, which has been surrounded by government troops since 2013. Food, medicine, and other basic necessities are nearly impossible to obtain. Imminent ground assault Eastern Ghouta is mostly held by two hardline rebel groups -- Jaish al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman -- though jihadists have a smaller foothold. The factions often fire rockets and mortar rounds into residential neighbourhoods of east Damascus. On Tuesday, at least four people were killed and 15 wounded by rebel fire on the capital, state television reported. Al-Watan newspaper, which is close to the government, said on Tuesday that the bombing campaign “comes ahead of a vast operation on Ghouta, which may start on the ground at any moment.” Both Al-Watan and the Observatory had earlier reported ongoing negotiations for the withdrawal of jihadists from the enclave. But the escalating bombardment suggests the regime will likely opt for a ground assault. It already waged a ferocious five-day air assault on Eastern Ghouta earlier this month that left around 250 civilians dead and hundreds wounded. More than 340,000 people have been killed since the civil war erupted in 2011 when protests against Assad’s government were brutally crushed. An array of rebels, some of them jihadist, have since carved out zones of control as have the Kurdish minority, and the government and its allies. Turkey has been waging an air and ground offensive against the Kurdish-controlled enclave of Afrin just across the border for the past month. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday defended the operation’s slow progress, saying it was to avoid putting the lives of both Turkish troops and civilians needlessly at risk. He told parliament Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies would lay siege to the town of Afrin “in the coming days.” Ankara says the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), which controls Afrin, is a “terrorist” offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since 1984.

[unused1] [unused2] 3-year-old playing with stove may have started deadly New York fire A child playing with a stove may have caused the fire in a New York City apartment building that killed 12 people, including four children, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday. The fire, the deadliest in the city in a quarter of a century, broke out a little before 7pm EST (midnight GMT) on Thursday on the first floor of a brick building and quickly spread upstairs, killing people on multiple floors, the New York City Fire Department said. “What we think at this point is that unfortunately it emanated from an accident, a young child playing with a stove on the first floor of the building,” de Blasio said in an interview with WNYC radio. Children ages 1, 2 and 7 died along with four men and four women, local media reported.An unidentified boy also died. Authorities said firefighters rescued 12 people from the building and four people were in the hospital in critical condition. More than 160 firefighters responded to the four-alarm blaze. The building, with 26 apartments, has at least six open building code violations, according to city records. One violation was for a broken smoke detector in an apartment on the first floor, reported in August. It was not clear if the detector had been fixed or replaced or whether it had played any role in the fire. “I know there were concerns raised about the building itself,” de Blasio told WNYC. “Based on the research we have at this moment, it does not appear there was anything problematic about the building or the fire safety in the building.” The building is in the Belmont section of the Bronx, a primarily residential, close-knit neighbourhood known as the “Little Italy” of the borough, near Fordham University and the Bronx Zoo. It was the deadliest fire in the city since an arsonist torched a Bronx nightclub in 1990, killing 87 people inside the venue that did not have fire exits, alarms or sprinklers, the New York Times reported. In 2007 10 immigrants from Mali, including nine children, died after a space heater caught fire in a Bronx building.

[unused1] [unused2] 5 die in Peru juvenile detention centre blaze: Police. Lima, February 15. Five detainees at a juvenile centre in Peru’s northern city of Trujillo died on Thursday when a blaze broke out in the facility during a revolt, police said. “Right now, we know we have five people dead—five minors who have died. We are still at the site,” police official Helber Ordonez told AFP. “There was a rebellion,” he said. Some detainees had set fire to mattresses in one part of the centre “and as a result the blaze started,” he said. Thirty other detainees were hurt and were taken to hospital, emergency officials and local media said. Some were seen being carried to ambulances and municipal vans. The fierce heat from the fire initially made it difficult for police to enter the facility, media reported. It was not immediately known how many young offenders were in the Juvenile Diagnosis and Rehabilitation Centre in Trujillo, located 500 kilometres north of the capital Lima. A couple of years ago, the establishment’s director complained that although the facility was built to hold 80 minors it had more than twice that crowded inside. Peruvian television showed images of relatives gathered outside the centre, anxious for news of what was happening inside. “Please, we want to know the truth. There are people dead, they aren’t at the hospital. My son is inside,” the mother of one detainee sobbed in a video posted by the newspaper Correo. Columns of smoke were seen rising from the site, and it was reported fire crews had brought the flames under control after a three-hour operation. Trujillo, Peru’s main northern city, has high a high crime rate, much of it linked to gangs and drug traffickers. Pope Francis visited the city in January during a South America tour. — AFP

[unused1] [unused2] 70 killed in Quetta hospital bombing A suicide bomber in Pakistan killed at least 70 people and wounded more than a hundred today in an attack on mourners gathered at a hospital in Quetta, according to officials in the southwestern province of Baluchistan. The bomber struck as a crowd of mostly lawyers and journalists crammed into the emergency department to accompany the body of a prominent lawyer who had been shot and killed in the city earlier in the day, Faridullah, a reporter who was among the wounded, told Reuters. The White House today condemned the suicide attack. "That this attack occurred at a hospital and appeared to target a gathering of lawyers mourning the death of a respected colleague makes it all the more heinous," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement. Abdul Rehman Miankhel, a senior official at the government-run Civil Hospital, where the explosion occurred, told reporters that at least 70 people had been killed, with more than 112 wounded, as the casualty toll spiked from initial estimates. "There are many wounded, so the death toll could rise," said Rehmat Saleh Baloch, the provincial health minister. Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, a faction of the militant Pakistani Taliban group, claimed responsibility for the attack in an email. It was not immediately clear if the group had carried out the bombing, as it is believed to have claimed responsibility for attacks in the past that it was not involved in. "The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaat-ur-Ahrar (TTP-JA) takes responsibility for this attack, and pledges to continue carrying out such attacks," said spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan in the statement. Only last week, Jamaat was added to the US's list of global terrorists, triggering sanctions. TV footage showed scenes of chaos at the hospital in Quetta, with panicked people fleeing through debris as smoke filled the hospital corridors. Bodies lay strewn across a hospital courtyard shortly after the blast and pools of blood collected as emergency rescuers rushed to identify survivors. The motive behind the attack was unclear, but several lawyers have been targeted during a recent spate of killings in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan. “Islamic State fighters are currently carrying out an attack inside the state broadcasting building in the city of Jalalabad,” the movement's AMAQ news agency said in a statement on instant messaging service Telegram. Security forces killed the three other attackers in the gun battle. The Taliban, who also have a strong presence in the region, denied responsibility. Islamic State has recently been hit hard by US air strikes and operations by special forces. The head of Islamic State in Afghanistan, Abdul Hassib, was reported this month to have been killed in a joint Afghan-US operation in Nangarhar at the end of April. Islamic State has also claimed responsibility for a series of high-profile attacks in the capital, Kabul, including one in March on Afghanistan's largest military hospital

[unused1] [unused2] New volcano discovered. A new volcano has been discovered under the ice in Antarctica. The active volcano which is currently unnamed was discovered by a group of scientists who had installed seismometers in the area. It is the first volcano discovered under the ice in Antarctica. After the seismometers were installed in 2010 in the Marie Byrd Land, (west of the continent) two swarms of earthquakes were detected. The earthquakes measured 0.8 and 2.1 with depths of 15 to 25 miles and were a year apart. The shallow earthquakes with low frequency indicated that a volcano was present. These earthquakes are known as Deep Long Period Earthquakes (DPL) which occur in volcanic areas. The volcano is believed to have erupted in the past and will erupt in the again future; causing the ice sheet to melt which in turn will result in a small rise in the sea level.
[unused1] [unused2] Greeks clean up, mourn after floods kill 16; four still missing Residents on the western fringes of the Greek capital struggled Thursday to clean up the devastation from flash floods that swept through their neighborhoods a day earlier, while the death toll rose as rescue crews searching for missing people recovered another body. The number of deaths from Wednesday’s flooding increased to 16 after firefighters found the body of a man in the swamped basement of a home in the Nea Peramos district west of Athens. Search and rescue operations were continuing Thursday for four more people reported missing since the floods turned roads into violent torrents of mud and debris. The disaster was among the worst to hit the Greek capital in decades, and the government declared a day of national mourning. Flags across the country flew at half-staff Thursday, including at the ancient Acropolis landmark in Athens. The hardest hit area was Mandra, a modest working-class district on the western outskirts of the Greek capital, where nearly all the fatalities occurred. Authorities said about 500 homes and businesses were damaged. Wednesday’s flash floods, which came after a severe overnight storm, carried away vehicles, collapsed walls, sank fishing boats and submerged a section of a major highway “There is huge damage. Inestimable damage,” Mandra Mayor Ioanna Kriekouki told local media. Twelve of the 23 injured remained hospitalized, including an 82-year-old woman listed as being in serious condition in an intensive care unit, the National Health Operations Center said. Cars lay piled on top of each other or flung against buildings after being carried away by the torrents sweeping through the area’s streets. Some houses and businesses saw outer walls collapse, leaving the interior exposed to the elements. Rubble, twisted metal and smashed vehicles lined the roads. “As you can see, everything is a mess,” said local resident Katerina Sideri. More storms lashed the Greek capital on Thursday, temporarily severing traffic on one of Athens’ main central avenues, although they did not cause flash floods. Local municipalities were providing hotel rooms for those left homeless, while the Merchant Marine Ministry said it was making arrangements for a cruise ship to dock on the coast near the affected area to provide temporary accommodation. It also said arrangements were being made with the army and navy to provide water tankers to transport clean water to residents. Nearly all the injuries and fatalities occurred in Mandra and the surrounding area. Twelve of the dead were found there, while the bodies of two men were picked up by the coast guard after having been swept out to sea by the flood. The victims ranged in ages from mid-30s to 80s, and included a truck driver swept away by floodwater, a hunter and several people who drowned in their flooded homes. Most of those who died had drowned, a coroner at the hospital told local reporters, while some appeared to have died from injuries sustained from debris being carried by the floodwater. The fire department said Thursday it had received 660 calls for help to pump water from flooded homes and businesses since Wednesday morning, while it had rescued 88 people trapped in houses and vehicles. All fire services in the wider Athens area remained on alert as more bad weather was forecast for the area.
[unused1] [unused2] Five-day assault on Syria enclave by government forces kills more than 400 Fresh bombardment on Eastern Ghouta has killed dozens, bringing the number of dead civilians in a five-day assault by the Syrian government to more than 400. Mounting calls for a humanitarian truce in one of the bloodiest episodes of Syria’s seven-year conflict failed to stop 46 more people being killed on Thursday by air strikes and rocket fire. Regime backer Russia said there was “no agreement” at the UN Security Council on a 30-day ceasefire for Syria and presented amendments to a draft resolution that would allow aid deliveries and the evacuation of civilians from besieged Eastern Ghouta. As diplomats wrangled over a UN vote, which could take place Friday, people huddled in basements while government forces pounded the enclave with rockets and bombs, turning towns into fields of ruins and even hitting hospitals. Aid group Doctors Without Borders said 13 of the facilities it supports in Eastern Ghouta were damaged or destroyed in three days, leaving remaining staff with very little to save the hundreds of wounded brought to them every day. In the hospital mortuary in Douma, the main town in the enclave just east of Damascus, bodies wrapped in white shrouds were already lined up on the floor, two of them children. “Five days of air strikes and intense artillery fire by the regime and its Russian ally have killed 403 civilians, including 95 children,” said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Morning rain appeared to initially keep warplanes away yesterday but the sky cleared by midday and jets, some of them Russian according to the Observatory, soon returned. Russia has so far denied direct involvement in the assault on Ghouta but the pro-government Syrian newspaper Al-Watan reported yesterday that Russian warplanes and advisers had joined the battle. The US said yesterday Russia had “unique responsibility” for the deaths. “Without Russia backing Syria, the devastation and the deaths would certainly not be occurring,” State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert told journalists. Regime and allied forces have been massing around the enclave, in which an estimated 400,000 people live, ahead of a likely ground offensive to flush out holdout Islamist and jihadist groups. “We are 14 women and children living in a room that is 10 feet wide, with no toilet and nowhere to wash,” said 53-year-old Umm Abdo, who joined a large group in the basement of a school in Arbin. The brief respite provided by the rain yesterday encouraged some residents to venture out of their basements and shelters, to buy food, check on their property or enquire about their relatives and neighbours. In the town of Hammuriyeh, a queue had formed outside a shop as starving residents tried to stock up but another rocket sowed panic and sent everybody back to their shelters. In Douma, a young boy tried to peddle lighters on the street but rocket fire quickly forced him to scamper back to cover. An AFP correspondent saw rescuers known as the “White Helmets” forced to abandon efforts to retrieve a wounded woman from the rubble of a collapsed home when air strikes resumed. When they ventured back to the site, the woman was dead. The indiscriminate bombardment and the strikes on medical facilities have sparked global outrage but few concrete options have emerged to stop the bloodletting. The aid community voiced its frustration as the world appeared once again powerless to stop a conflict that has left almost 350,000 dead in seven years and caused destruction rarely seen since World War II. Humanitarian agencies are “sickened that no matter how many times they’ve raised the alarm, taken the step of speaking out, called on the Security Council to do something, the violence and brutality will sink to new lows”, said the Syria INGO Regional Forum. At the UN, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said sponsors Sweden and Kuwait were requesting a vote on the ceasefire plan even though they are “fully aware there is no agreement on it”. The Security Council needs to reach a “feasible” agreement on a ceasefire and not take a decision that would be “populistic” and “severed from reality”, he said. Talks for a deal between the regime and the armed groups controlling Ghouta appear to have stalled. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said jihadist fighters in Ghouta had rejected an evacuation deal. “A few days ago, our military in Syria suggested to the fighters that they withdraw peacefully from Eastern Ghouta, like the evacuation of fighters and their families that was organised in East Aleppo,” he said. The head of the defence committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament said Thursday that more than 200 new types of weapons were tested as part of his country’s military support to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. “It’s not an accident that today they are coming to us from many directions to purchase our weapons, including countries that are not our allies,” he said

[unused1] [unused2] Two killed, 28 injured in amusement park crash in Ahmedabad Two people were killed and 27 injured after a ride at an amusement park in Ahmedabad’s Kankaria Lake area came crashing down on Sunday evening. Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said the injured were admitted to LG Hospital. “An inquiry has been ordered. Police, along with a forensic team, reached the spot to find out the reasons behind the accident,” Nehra said. “Twenty-nine people were brought to the hospital out of whom two died while 27 are being treated,” said Ahmedabad mayor Bijal Patel. While police were yet to lodge an FIR when the reports last came in, government officials said the victims were adults. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) chief fire officer MF Dastoor said the accident took place as a pipe of the main shaft of the amusement ride called ‘Discovery’ broke, causing it to fall down. “There are 32 seats in the ride that go round. The pipe of the main shaft broke and crashed on the ground. How that pipe broke is a matter of investigation by Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL),” said Dastoor. Police officials, led by Ahmedabad Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone 6, Bipin Ahire, who reached the spot, said it was not immediately clear if the welded part that held the ride from its hinges on the top gave away or its nuts and bolts were loose leading to the roller coaster come crashing on the ground. Nehra said preliminary investigations indicated that the number of riders was within the capacity. Thirty-one persons were said to be on the ride. Kankaria Lake is one of the most prominent outing spots located in the heart of Ahmedabad’s Maninagar area. The AMC issues licence to entertainment and food zone contractors. While the opposition Congress alleged negligence on part of AMC, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit back over what it called attempts to politicise deaths. “The ruling BJP failed to ensure regular maintenance. A complaint of negligence should be registered against AMC authorities,” said Congress councillor Baddrudin Sheikh. Mayor Patel said, “An inquiry will be conducted to ascertain as to what went wrong, and steps against those responsible for the fault will be taken soon.”

[unused1] [unused2] Pune: 29 vehicles charred in 2 mystery fires Fifth incident in a week, police say primary reason could be short-circuit, but cannot rule out foul play.

[unused1] [unused2] Save The Children: 7 killed in airstrike on Yemen hospital A hospital in a rural area of northwest Yemen was hit by an airstrike Tuesday killing seven people and wounding eight others, Save the Children said. The international aid organization, which supports the hospital, said in a statement sent to the Associated Press that four of those killed were children and two adults are unaccounted for. Save The Children said a missile struck a petrol station near the entrance to Ritaf rural hospital, about 100 kilometers from the city of Saada at 9:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday. "The missile was said to have landed within 50 meters of the facility's main building," it said. The organization said the hospital had been open for half an hour and many patients and staff were arriving on a busy morning. Among the dead were a health worker and the worker's two children and a security guard, it said. Save the Children, which reported earlier this week that 37 Yemeni children a month had been killed or injured by foreign bombs in the last year, demanded an urgent investigation into the attack. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the organization's chief executive, said: "We are shocked and appalled by this outrageous attack." "Innocent children and health workers have lost their lives in what appears to been an indiscriminate attack on a hospital in a densely populated civilian area," she said. "Attacks like these are a breach of international law." Thorning-Schmidt said the hospital is one of many Save the Children supports in Yemen, "but time after time, we see a complete disregard by all warring parties in Yemen for the basic rules of war." The conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by Iranian-backed Houthi Shiite rebels, who toppled the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. A Saudi-led coalition allied with Hadi's internationally recognized government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015. Saudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia and targeted vessels in the Red Sea. The fighting in the Arab world's poorest country has killed thousands of civilians, left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages, and pushed the country to the brink of famine. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has said about 80 percent of Yemen's population 24 million people need humanitarian assistance including nearly 10 million "just a step away from famine" and nearly 240,000 "facing catastrophic levels of hunger." Thorning-Schmidt called for an immediate suspension of arms sales to the warring parties and diplomatic pressure to end the conflict. "We must stop this war on children," she said.

[unused1] [unused2] Driver killed as truck crashes into trailer carrying iron rods on EPE GREATER NOIDA: A 35-year-old truck driver was killed and his father sitting next to him was injured when the lorry crashed into a stationary trailer laden with iron rods on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The early morning accident raised questions on why long vehicles with iron rods protruding from them are allowed to be parked along the expressway. These stationary trucks pose dangers to speeding vehicles, particularly near the bends. Around 5am on Tuesday, Mohammed Rafique (35) was driving the truck (NL01Q1321) — owned by Varuna Integrated Logistics — towards Dadri when he crashed into the trailer parked near Bambawad village. Iron rods jutting out of the trailer smashed the glass of the truck and Rafique was squeezed between the steering and his seat. His father Chaman Khan, who was seated next to him, suffered injuries to the ankle and nose. Residents of nearby villages informed police and a team from the nearest police station rushed to the spot. The truck and the trailer were tied to separate vehicles and pulled apart. Rafique’s body, which was stuck between the steering and seat, was then brought out of the truck. “It took almost an hour to bring out the body as villagers and the police struggled to pull the vehicles apart. Rafique’s chest and legs were stuck between steering and the seat as the front portion of the truck was mangled,” said a police officer inspecting the spot. An NHAI ambulance rushed Rafique’s father Chaman to the Dadri community health centre around 8.45am. A doctor there said Chaman had suffered injuries to his ankle and nose, but was out of danger. Vinay Kumar, the SHO of Badalpur police station, said Rafique’s family had been informed about the accident and they had arrived at the hospital to take the body. Mohammed Naeem, Chaman’s nephew, said Rafique’s employer had lodged a complaint at Badalpur police station against the driver of the trailer who had parked the vehicle loaded with iron rods on one side of the expressway. He questioned why no action was taken by the NHAI on such stationary trucks parked along the EPE, which often pose dangers to speeding vehicles. “My cousin met a tragic death. But it could have been avoided had the authorities taken action against such stationary vehicles,” he said. Kumar told TOI that an FIR had been registered under sections 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (mischief causing damage), 304 A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC against the driver of the goods carrier trailer.

[unused1] [unused2] Airstrike on remote Yemen hospital kills at least seven At least seven people, including four children, have died after an airstrike hit the entrance to a hospital in a remote rebel-controlled area of Yemen, Save the Children has said. Two more people are unaccounted for and eight were injured after a western-backed coalition missile blew up a petrol station next to Kitaf hospital in Saada province on Tuesday morning, the charity said. The hospital had just opened for the day and many staff and patients were arriving at the building. One healthcare worker and their two children are among the dead, according to the organisation, which funds the facility. Local media published pictures of the building, which appeared to have been levelled. No comment was immediately forthcoming from the Saudi-led military coalition operating in Yemen to free the country from Houthi rebels and restore the exiled government. The attack coincided with the fourth anniversary of the Saudi coalition intervention in Yemen’s civil war, which has killed at least 60,000 people, left half the country’s 22 million population food insecure and sparked the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. “We are shocked and appalled by this outrageous attack,” said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Save the Children’s chief executive. “Innocent children and health workers have lost their lives in what appears to have been an indiscriminate attack on a hospital in a densely populated civilian area,” she said. “Attacks like these are a breach of international law.” The coalition and the western governments who supply it with arms have been repeatedly criticised by rights groups and conflict monitors for bombing campaigns which have hit schools, health facilities, funeral gatherings and wedding parties, killing thousands of civilians. Yemen’s government and Saudi Arabia accuse the Houthis of using civilians as human shields. The Houthis have launched long-range missiles into neighbouring Saudi Arabia and targeted Saudi ships in the Red Sea.

[unused1] [unused2] Biker killed after dangling wire on Delhi’s Signature Bridge pierces chest A 24-year-old electrician was killed on the Signature Bridge early Thursday morning, while he was riding his bike home in northeast Delhi’s Sonia Vihar. His family members alleged that a thick metal wire attached to a winch and the bridge, which allegedly broke off during Wednesday’s dust storm, pierced his chest after hitting his head and face.

All the cables are intact and not a single one was dangling. Also, nothing fell from the pylon,” said Bansal. The police, on the other hand, said that the person who had informed the police control room about the incident had also mentioned a broken metal wire.

A case of death by negligence under Section 304A of the IPC has been registered. We are trying to ascertain the sequence of events that led to the accident and the biker’s death. Whether the cable was dangling or some metal fell off the bridge and hit him is a matter for the probe,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (northeast).

[unused1] [unused2] 23 dead as Iran battles heavy rain and floods Iran battled torrential rain and floods across most of the country on Tuesday, warning citizens to stay vigilant after unprecedented flash flooding killed 23 people. The authorities also announced for the first time that seven people were killed a week ago in separate floods that swept the northeastern provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran. The latest deluge claimed the lives of 19 people and injured 98 in the worst-hit southern city of Shiraz, the rescue services said. There was also one death in each of the western provinces of Kermanshah, Lorestan and Kogiluyeh-Va-Boyerahmad, and another in the southwestern province of Khuzestand. The disaster, which the energy minister blamed on climate change, struck in the middle of Iranian New Year holidays, with many relief workers on vacation and millions of Iranians on the roads. On Tuesday the authorities sent out emergency warnings to the public on mobile phones as state television aired safety tips, including on how to leave cars stuck in floods. supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message of condolence and urged officials to speed up relief efforts and compensation for victims of the floods, which the authorities described as unprecedented. Overall, at least 110 people were injured in this week's flooding, the health ministry said. More than 25,000 had to be put up in emergency accommodation, according to the Iranian Red Crescent Society. With at least 20 of Iran's 31 provinces experiencing floods or facing an imminent threat and more than 250 cities and villages needing emergency assistance, the country's National Crisis Management Committee was put on its highest alert level. Iran's meteorological service has warned of more heavy showers through to Wednesday, and flood warnings have gone out for central provinces including Isfahan and Tehran. In the capital sandbags were laid at the entrances to underground stations as police made emergency plans to divert traffic from freeways already impeded by runoff from the downpour. In top tourist attraction Isfahan, residents and travellers were evacuated from the banks of the Zayandeh Rood river over fears they would burst. The river had been completely dry until recently due low rainfall. As the weather front moves to the east of Iran, more and more regions of the country that had been facing chronic water shortages a few months ago have been inundated with water. The downpour has triggered scores of landslides that have blocked roads, especially in mountainous regions. One buried an entire village in Kogiluyeh-Va-Boyerahmad province shortly after residents were evacuated, the semi-official Fars News agency quoted its governor as saying. Hundreds of villages in western Iran have been cut off with many also losing electricity and normal water supplies, forcing authorities to deploy military helicopters to try to save and supply those left stranded. Overnight the crisis management committee sent out multiple text messages to all mobile telephones in Iran urging people to be cautious and await instructions from official sources. "Remain calm when facing possible dangers... do not honk your car horns in mountainous regions as it might cause avalanches," one of the messages read. "Do not set up tents near rivers or mountainous areas... and most importantly do not cross bridges when floods are running underneath," read another one. The floods followed extreme rainfall which at times was equivalent to half of the average annual levels within 24 hours. Such a widespread flood threat is unprecedented in arid Iran, which until 2018 was dealing with decades of drought. "Climate change is forcing itself on our country," said Energy Minister Reza Ardekanian, who is in charge of dams and water supply. "These unprecedented floods in our country are because of climate change worldwide," he said on Monday, quoted by the Tasnim news agency.

[unused1] [unused2] 1 killed, 14 rescued after fire breaks out in 4-storey building in Colaba A 54-year-old man was killed, while 14 others were rescued after a major fire broke out in a four-storey residential building behind the iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Colaba. The fire was reported in a third-floor flat of the more than 80-year-old Churchill Chambers building around noon on Sunday. It was restricted to the electric installations and furniture of the apartment that belonged to the victim, Shyam Iyer. Firefighters said Iyer died trying to douse the flames in his apartment. It took the fire brigade two hours to put out the fire. “Iyer was found in a critically burnt condition in the corner of his flat, where the severity of fire was the most intense,” said chief fire officer Prabhat Rahangdale. “He was taken to hospital but declared dead before arrival,” said Rahangdale, adding that it was easy to rescue people as the building’s windows did not have grills. “However, it was an old construction, with narrow a staircase, where the heavy smoke made the firefighting operations difficult,” Rahangdale said. Yusuf Poonawala, 43, also a resident of the building, is being treated at Bombay Hospital for suffocation. No other major injuries were reported. Suresh Keswani, a resident of the adjacent building, said, “Around noon, I heard people from the building crying for help. I rushed to the spot and helped some people down when the fire brigade arrived.” Bhurmal Santosh Patil, a 29-year-old firefighter, was injured, but treated in an ambulance and discharged. The fire brigade also took the help of residents. Rocky Lobo, who lived on the second floor of the building, said, “I went to the third floor with the firefighters as I knew the internal routes of the building. The fire officers told me to open all accessible windows and doors for the smoke to go out. We also rescued some residents to a safe place. The fire brigade has done a commendable job.” “The Colaba police, who are investigating the fire, have registered a case of accidental death,” said Pranay Ashok, PRO and deputy commissioner of police, Mumbai Police. Shyam Iyer, 54, died trying to douse the fire with buckets of water. The fire broke out inside his apartment on the third floor of Churchill Chamber. Fire brigade officials said Iyer had sent his wife down to safety with the other residents, but ended up getting trapped in the fire. One of the residents of the building said, “Iyer was in his bedroom, which mostly had wooden furniture and wooden flooring. That is where the fire broke out.” Iyer, a businessman, is survived by his wife. The fire brigade said the rescue operation got easier and there were few casualties as the windows of the building did not have grills on them. “This saved us a lot of time as the firemen could get easy access into the building,” said chief fire officer Prabhat Rahangdale. “In the case of heritage buildings, old constructions and excessive use of wood, such as this one, it makes the rescue and fire-fighting operations more challenging,” Rahangdale added.

[unused1] [unused2] Chennai: 78-year-old man, home alone, found killed CHENNAI: A 78-year-old man was found killed in his house near Mangadu on Sunday. Police suspect that he could have been murdered for gain as there were marks of strangulation on his neck and other injuries on the body. Valuables were also reported missing by family members. Police said Bhaskaran, of Kurinji Street in Madhananthapuram near Mangadu, lived alone on the second floor of his apartment since a domestic dispute in 2013. His wife Susheela moved with their second son Mahendra Prabu’s family to Manimangalam a few years ago. Their older son lives abroad. The house on the ground floor of the building remained vacant, and the house on first floor was rented out to a man called Ganesh. While Bhaskaran’s house remained locked for the past few days, neighbours were under the impression that he was out of town. However, sensing a foul smell from the house on Sunday they alerted the Mangadu police and the man’s son Mahendra Prabu. Police broke open the house and found Bhaskaran’s decomposed body. “There was a broken brick lying near the body and his lungi was around the neck, which we suspect the murderer could have used to strangulate him. There were injuries on the head as well,” an investigating officer said. Police suspect him to have died at least five days ago. Susheela and Mahendra Prabu informed police that the jewellery he was wearing and his moped parked inside the building compound were missing. The body was sent to a government hospital for postmortem. Tenant Ganesh told police that he last saw Bhaskaran on July 16. There were no CCTV cameras on the premises or the street. “We are combing surveillance footage from the neighbouring streets in the locality to see if there was any suspicious movement, and to check if someone escaped on the missing moped,” said an investigating officer. Fingerprint experts and sniffer dogs were pressed into service. Meanwhile, police found the security guard of an apartment opposite Bhaskaran’s house missing for the past three days. Bhaskaran used to go for tea and on walks with him. A team is trying to check if the security guard is in his residence in Tiruvannamalai.

[unused1] [unused2] At least 28 killed as Afghan bus hits roadside bomb: official Dozens of passengers, mainly women and children, were killed in western Afghanistan early Wednesday when the bus they were travelling in hit a roadside bomb, officials said. “A passenger bus travelling on the Kandahar-Herat highway hit a Taliban roadside bomb. So far at least 28 killed, 10 wounded,” said Muhibullah Muhib, the spokesman for Farah province, adding that all were civilians. Farooq Barakzai, a spokesman for Farah’s governor, confirmed the toll but warned it may rise higher. There was no immediate confirmation from the Taliban that it was behind the attack. It came one day after the United Nations said civilians are being killed and wounded at a “shocking” level in Afghanistan’s war, despite a push to end the nearly 18-year-old conflict. Casualties have dropped 27% in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year, which was a record, but nonetheless 1,366 civilians were killed and another 2,446 injured. The UN branded efforts to reduce the violence “insufficient”. It also said that U.S. and pro-government forces caused more civilian deaths than the Taliban and other insurgent groups for the second quarter running. Child casualties represented almost one-third of the overall total of civilian casualties. The bloodshed comes amid a months-long, U.S.-led push to forge a peace deal with the Taliban that would see foreign forces quit the country in return for various security guarantees.

[unused1] [unused2] 57 dead in Brazil prison riot At least 57 prisoners were killed by other inmates during clashes between organized crime groups in the Altamira prison in northern Brazil Monday with 16 of the victims being decapitated, according to prison officials. Para state prison authorities a fight erupted around 7 a.m., between the Rio de Janeiro-based Comando Vermelho and a local criminal group known as Comando Classe A. “Leaders of the (Comando Classe A) set fire to a cell belonging to one of the prison’s pavilions, where members of the (Comando Vermelho) were located,” the statement read. State prisons chief Jarbas Vasconcelos said the fire had spread rapidly, with inmates held in old container units that had been adapted for the prison while another building is under construction. The fire prevented police forces from entering the building for several hours, he told a news conference. Two prison staff members were held hostage, but eventually released. “It was a targeted attack. The aim was to show that it was a settling of accounts between the two groups, not a protest or rebellion against the prison system,” Vasconcelos said. Authorities have not found any firearms following the riot, only makeshift knives. Prison authorities said 46 inmates will be transferred to other prisons, 10 of which will go to stricter federal facilities. President Jair Bolsonaro was elected on the promise of curbing widespread violence in Brazil, including in the country’s often overcrowded, out-of-control prisons. obtained a July 2019 report from the National Justice Council that it says was filed by a local judge in charge of the facility, showing that the prison had 343 detainees for a maximum capacity of 163. Yet Vasconcelos said the situation did not meet the official requirements to be considered overcrowded. “It is not a unit that has a prison overcrowding, we consider overcrowding when it exceeds 210%,” Vasconcelos said during the press conference. The judge who filed the report described the overall state of the prison in the city of Altamira as “terrible.” In many of Brazil’s prisons, badly outnumbered guards struggle to retain power over an ever-growing population of inmates who are able to run criminal activities from behind bars. The killings echoed those of 55 inmates who died in a series of riots in May in several prisons in the neighboring state of Amazonas. In early 2017, more than 120 inmates died in prisons across several northern states when rival gangs clashed over control of drug-trafficking routes in the region. The violence lasted several weeks, spreading to various states. Para state authorities spent the afternoon in Altamira, drafting a security plan to avoid possible retaliations in the region. Police forces from the nearby municipality of Santerem were sent as reinforcement in the coming weeks. Prison authorities said they had not received any prior intelligence reports of an upcoming attack. The prison is run directly by the state, not a third-party private operator as in the Manaus prisons where the riots took place in May.
